These are so easily made vegan-just use two units of Ener-g Egg Replacer (3 tsp of powder mixed with 4 Tbsp of water) in place of the eggs and the veggie crumble mixture holds up beautifully. This totally made me rethink trying other Eastern European inspired food-I always thought that it was largely bland (I come from the South and enjoy a fair amount of spice), but this was very flavorful-and also fun to make. Another note is that if you are watching your salt and want to use a reduced sodium tomato soup, I would recommend adding about 1/2 tsp of sodium free salt alternative to the veggie crumble mixture. Lastly, I ended up making 8 smaller rolls out of this by adding around 4-5 Tbsp of mixture for each cabbage leaf. Thanks for this delicious recipe!",2011-02-03T14:08:51Z,2011-02-03T14:08:51Z

Only problem was that the dough turned crumbly after mixing, even though I followed directions and softened the butter before use. To solve, I added a few drops of water at a time to the crumbly dough, until it was smooth and pliable. A tip I read: use confectioner sugar instead of flour to roll out dough. That really helped add more sweetness! I'm giving a 4 due to not needing to refrigerate prior to use, recipe ease, and fact that dough held the cookie cutter shapes.

1188596,17186,125524,StylinDog,4,"After reading several reviews I decided to make this recipe anyway, with a few alterations. I used cheeses I had on hand, which turned out to be 1 cup old white cheddar, 1/2 cup swiss, 1/2 cup mozza, plus the velveeta. Instead of seasoning salt I used a bit of old bay and about a 1/2 tsp of mustard powder. Didn't have heavy cream on hand, so subbed a 50-50 mix of table cream and 2% milk, and I increased the amount by about 1/3 cup (for extra creaminess and to finish off the milk in the container). After cooking and draining the pasta I lightly fried 1 lb of chopped cooked ham before returning the pasta to the pot and carrying on with the recipe. Never made a mac and cheese with eggs before, I have always done it by making a cheese sauce. This method was a little unorthodox to me and I did add the eggs to the milk/cream mixture before adding it to the pasta, but it all worked out well in the end. I split this recipe into two 8 inch round casseroles, using a bit of the reserved cheese to add a hidden layer of deliciousness. For topping, I used the remaining reserved cheese but also added some finely chopped bacon and breadcrumbs (sorry, I didn't measure, just eyeballed it) because I like a crunchy crumbly topping. My husband and I enjoyed it, but I made quite a few changes to the original recipe.",2011-02-03T18:26:03Z,2011-02-03T18:26:03Z

I made the mistake of trying to fry several batches of meatballs in a row. The pan in which I was frying them got coated with too much burnt material, so when I tried to make the roux, I had all these little black bits (not pretty).

Same exact recipe with applesauce in place of butter (used butter nut flavoring), left out the cocoa and added about 3/4 cup shredded carrots and 2 teaspoons cinnamon.. OMG! TRY THAT!

And then I only used about another 2/3 cup of water (1 2/3 cup liquid instead of 2 cups). Then I baked for 55 minutes total and it set up just fine.

1188686,333107,286566,ImPat,4,"First of all changes I made, for dietary reasons I omitted onion and peppers and upped the mushrooms (swiss brown) to 2 cups (I scaled back for 5 serves but got 8)and I used fresh pasta sheets (no cooking) and fresh basil, oregano and garlic (all from the garden) and a basil pasta sauce for the tomato puree (I think the pasta sauce is our equivalent in Australia) but this is were I OOPSED - I sauted of the mushrooms and set aside and then cooked the extra lean mince (ground beef) and just automatically put in the mushrooms and all the pasta sauce.  My layering went like this (my dish would only allow me 2 layers) meat sauce, cream cheese mix, some mozzarella, lasagne noodle sheet, meat sauce, cream cheese mix, mozzarella, lasange sheet and finally meat sauce and mozzarella and covered and cooked as directed.  At the 45 minute point I removed the alfoil which took a fair amount of the cheese with it so sprinkled some more on top (hadn't used it all) and back in the oven till a nice golden colour.  The surprise factor was that when we have previously tried lasagne using ricotta is that it has a curdled effect which has put us off but I think the blending of the cream cheese (in both cases I used the lowest fat one I could get) minimised this and there were no ""YUK"" reactions and with a salad and garlic bread was very much enjoyed.

Next time I will omit the asparagus or boil until crispy tender. I did not care for the flavor the roasting imparted to the asparagus. I  cut back on the cheese to about 1 1/4 C using a combo of  cheddar &  gouda.  I also used FF milk. I think a higher fat milk would work better.

All the versions posted on this site are remarkably similar, but I particularly like this one and number 88304 because they are completely from scratch and nicely formatted with dough and filling ingredients listed separately.  Interestingly to me, they represent the 'rich man-poor man' variations on the theme.  Or maybe we could say the rich and the low fat version.  This one uses water instead of milk, 1 egg instead of two,  very little fat and sugar.  A little bit less meat.  To really kick this into high gear as the dieter's nutritious option, going with the higher amount of cabbage (up to 4 c) that a lot of the other versions use, and adding 1/2 c onion and a grated carrot to the filling would work well.

Sure, it tastes fine if you let it cook double the amount of time called for in the recipe, but then you have to worry about having burnt crust.

My husband was shocked when he tasted them because he always thinks vegetarian=boring. The onion mix is salty enough so no other real need for salty spices. I love putting these in a vegetarian sauce and even a vegetarian chili. Who am I kidding, I'll eat them right off the pan!<br/><br/>As for people with nut allergies, it is well known that we live in a world where more and more people are becoming prone to allergies. No matter if you know the person or not you should always state if their are nuts in the dish. Having said this, I'm sure NO ONE would deliberately mislead someone and not mention that this dish has nuts in it. That would be offensive, rude and dangerous. Please take into consideration of others, even when leaving reviews. They can come off as rude, especially if you are stating ""not to trick people.""",2011-02-04T16:16:22Z,2011-02-04T16:16:22Z

I didn't have linguine pasta, so I just used angel hair, and I omitted the red pepper flakes (I think I'll add them in on a night when my husband is here to eat this with us though).  I also significantly decreased the oil used, (I used about 1T with the bread crumbs, and about 2-3T with the lemon juice mix) and just increased the amount of pasta water to compensate.  And one last thing, I let the pasta cool for about 10 minutes before adding in the spinach, because I don't care for cooked spinach, and this way the pasta was still warm enough to warm the spinach, but not hot enough to wilt and cook it.  <br/><br/>Goodness, when you type that all out it sounds like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't, and the dish was absolutely wonderful.",2011-02-04T22:02:14Z,2011-02-04T22:02:14Z

1188901,8782,81369,PsychoCasseroleStep,5,I did not read the recipe through and realize that it needed to marinate overnight until the day I was planning to cook it. So I just followed the recipe and skipped putting it in the fridge overnight. It was still delicious and the seasonings are versatile enough that I could incorporate the leftover chicken into many different recipes. I made some chicken salad and also a chicken noodle soup. The chicken literally fell off of the bone so easily I couldn't even pull the drumstick or wing off without everything falling open. Made it super easy to get every bit of chicken and no waste! Next time I will plan ahead and refrigerate overnight and I'm sure it will be even tastier. I will probably shorten the cooking time by 30 minutes because it was starting to dry out...but that is just an adjustment I need to make because of my oven and not a problem with the recipe.,2011-02-04T22:15:13Z,2011-02-04T22:15:13Z

I think using a good veg stock is essential.  The only thing I did differently was to add a few bay leaves, and more oregano, lemon & dill.  I think this is one of those stews that would really benefit from long simmering, I bet it will be fantastic tomorrow.  A few changes I'd be tempted to make next time would be to sautee the onion & garlic in more olive oil (it's a lot of onion after al) and to use only 2 cups of broth instead of 3.

I used low fat yoghurt (didn't support the pomegranate molasses as well for feathering with the knife but was lower fat) and had to use yellow mustard seeds-otherwise I got it right. I used both the whole spices and the powdered-I think the powdered blended into the yoghurt while the whole roasted spices gave lovely little bursts of extra flavour when you bit down on them. I have another theory too-roasted whole spices and powdered spices are as much the same as tomato and tomato paste-same thing, but much different tastes and often used in the same dish. As far as mess goes (see other review) I covered my chopping board with a little foil while I peeled and diced my oven roasted beetroot-so no mess.

It's just that good.  I used drained pork & beans instead of refried, used extra sour cream with dry onion soup mix instead of soup, added rotel to the meat mixture and spread salsa in the dish as sugested by other reviewers.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour.  That made it taste like enchiladas.  A great basic receipe.  Thanks for posting.",2011-02-05T10:17:06Z,2011-02-05T10:17:06Z

I used a no trans fat margarine for the butter and fat free evaporated milk for the cream (something I do with all recipes to lower fat). It's not bad but but not great either.

I made a half amount in a 10"" deep dish pie pan and DH and myself wiped out all but two servings last night *blush* . I used Splenda for the sugars (brown and while) and that worked perfectly. Cooking the cranberries first is brilliant and I really think that single step is what really this recipe special. As I do with 99.9% of the pie recipes I make I didn't use the pie crust but made a lower fat crisp topping with quick oats, pecan meal, brown Splenda, a light shake of cinnamon and a 1/4 cup of heart healthy margarine. While in the oven it fills the house with that wonderful aroma that makes everyone coming into the house smile.

I tried them out on my in-laws first and got great comments so I took it to the next level and started selling them.  My first order for them was for 3 dozen for a party.  I figured I would dress them up and make them look fancy so I baked them, let them cool then I added chocolate chips to some, drizzled with chocolate ganache, white chocolate ganache and caramel.   Each one was different and they were a HUGE HIT!  Just about all of them kinda caved in the middle after cooling which is why I decorated them (to hide the caving & browning on sides).  How do you keep it from caving?  I even baked for 5-10 minutes longer but it didn't make a difference. 5 STARS for taste, ease, and presentation.

My friend also uses vodka in his gazpacho, so I figured why not.<br/><br/>I did use a mix of balsamic and red wine, but you mentioned either or.  Again, that did not alter the overall taste.

1188997,48760,1329782,SarasotaCook,4,"Very torn about this review. When I review a recipe, I usually divide it in half and make it the original post and then add my changes. So here is the review.<br/><br/>First, I really didn't like the texture of the ground beef. I asked my butcher to take a round steak and rough grind it.  It gave me a more steak like texture and that made a huge difference  for me in the overall taste.<br/><br/>Second, I didn't find too much red pepper, it was fine for me.<br/><br/>Third, I did add broccoli because it was just to one dimensional for me, it need some texture and different flavors. I did use fresh broccoli and some fine match stick sliced carrots, just for a little crunch. I think that helped.<br/><br/>Overall the flavor was good, I used a good szechuan noodle but the sauce was not bad.<br/><br/>As one poster mentioned, it reminded them of an Asian Sloppy Joe over noodles. I agree in a way. That is why I think the carrots and broccoli and the meat texture really changed the texture, but not necessarily the flavor. I purchased my ground sirloin right at the regular grocery store. I just asked the butcher to rough grind it for me, or you can do it yourself at home.  I think it really helped the overall recipe.<br/><br/>I will try it again with a few changes. 3 stars for the texture and presentation; but 4 for the overall flavor<br/>Thx, Kim",2011-02-05T12:06:50Z,2011-02-05T12:06:50Z

I find vegan pancakes generally don't rise all that much as it is, but to help the process a bit I added about a tsp of vinegar to the soy milk, I think that helped a little.

It's so easy, I'm almost ashamed to have waited until now to make it.  I didn't do much measuring, just sampled as I went along and adjusted everything to my taste.  I made a double batch--one extra lemony with lots of garlic and dill, and the other with a little less garlic and no dill--so I'll be set for...well, at least the next couple of days.  My only complaint is that finding tahini in my area wasn't easy, and I had to make a special trip to a store where I usually never shop.  Once this jar runs out, I might try substituting a little bit of creamy peanut butter, since the flavor is similar and PB is much easier to find (and cheaper to buy,) or even leave it out entirely.",2011-02-05T15:15:34Z,2011-02-05T15:15:34Z

Also, I don't have onion salt so I used onion powder, and then when the light finally went off %u2014 YE GODS, NO SALT %u2014 I had to yank them out of the oven after about 5 minutes and try to add salt.

I used more grated peel than called for (whatever came off the whole orange) and fresh orange juice.  I did let it sit (hard to keep everyone away from it!) overnight as you described.  The texture is soft and very moist.

Also if you put a tortilla shell (I do one at a time) in the microwave, for about 12 seconds,on high,before you spread on the filling, they roll up much easier.

Instead of flour I dredged the chicken in corn starch.  I also used chicken cutlets (breasts cut in half lengthwise) and pounded them thin with a mallet.  For mushrooms I used 1/2 button and 1/2 baby bellas.  I also doubled the recipe.  I didn't double the marsala but should have.  It tasted a little weak.  Thickened the gravy a little at the end with corn starch.  I like to use corn starch instead of four in a recipe that benefits from translucense and leaves no starchy taste.<br/><br/>All in all a good recipe.,2011-02-06T18:54:54Z,2011-02-06T18:54:54Z

The one downside was only getting 12 muffins (my pan is normal sized and I could have filled the cups more), I was bringing them to work and there wasn't enough for everyone. My vanilla bean was a bit on the dry side so the vanilla didn't stand out more than usual but that didn't matter.

A keeper -- all I'd tweak next time is to salt the cucumbers beforehand to draw out some liquid. The taste was perfect. And may I suggest, this salad is perfect with spicy meat -- I happened to make a Moroccan-type meatball from a Zaar recipe, and it complemented each other perfectly. It would be perfect with a curry as well. Thanks, Parsley, this a great way to use this salad veggie! I used my food processor to slice the cucumber as thinly as possible.

I ended up eating more of these than anyone else (though my husband had his share of the dough...).  The cherry is a great touch (tried both apricot jam and cherry halves) and adds just the right amount of sweet to the cookie.  Make sure to mix the dough until it becomes VERY smooth (takes longer to mix than any cookies I've ever made) also the refrigeration definitely helped make them easy to separate into individual cookies (left them overnight in fridge).

I chose to make this recipe because of the taratoor sauce, and boy, am I glad I did. It tasted just like what we were served in Egypt (minus a sprinkle of ground cumin on top). The falafel was quite tasty too, though I felt the spices could easily be increased by 1.5. In the future I'll increase the parsley and add cilantro as well.

1189474,65816,1799668,mizjmassie,5,"I had to make different kind of potato salad for my sometimes picky husband because he doesn't like traditional potato salad with mayo and pickle relish. When I found this recipe, I knew it would be the right recipe for him since I know how he loves loaded baked potatoes and baked potato soup. Sure enough, I was right because he loved it and so did I. I did use fresh or real bacon. I also didn't use half sour cream and half mayo which most reviewers suggested. I figured since my husband and I both love all the flavors of a baked potato, I didn't see how I could go wrong and I was right. The salad was perfect.

I used 2 (5 oz.) chicken breasts, and it wasn't too much chicken (we didn't think). I used 3 tsp. of cajun seasoning, I cooked the chicken in olive oil, and used white onion in place of the green onion. I only had 1/4 c. whipping cream, so I used 3/4 cup fat free milk and thickened the sauce with 1 Tbsp water/1 Tbsp cornstarch slurry, and that worked great! I replaced the sundried tomatoes with diced tomatoes, because I don't like sundries tomatoes - it's a texture thing I think. Maybe a taste thing too, I dunno. Haha.

I made it half whole wheat and half all purpose, used the full dough cycle on my bread machine as I needed the time to work on other dishes for dinner. I used milk instead of water,  omitted the honey and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder as that's my favourite naan flavour. I used a baking sheet and it worked great, the naan rose a bit much so I had to squish it back down lol and because of time I browned the tops on a dry griddle on the stove but it still turned out quite lovely and my boys took it with cheese in between for sandwiches today :-).

1189559,189718,1817598,Whole Foods Chef Ju,5,"This is a wonderful recipe that, once again, shows just how good properly prepared food really tastes.  I used organic, fire roasted crushed tomatoes, which produced a thick, flavorful sauce.  I chopped the onion and celery rather fine and grated the carrots to better incorporate the flavors.  I used very little sea salt and freshly ground pepper - about 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. You want to taste the tomatoes afterall, not salt!  <br/><br/>High quality ingredients such as EVOO and freshly shaved Parmesano-Reggiano are a must.  The sauce can top whole grain spaghetti or spaghetti squash. The recipe in the book stressed the importance of cooking the pasta al dente (with a bite).  Only cook as much as you can consume in one meal - leftover spaghetti is no good (in this cook's humble opinion).  I never mix sauce and pasta either, just ladle over the spaghetti and top with freshly shaved cheese - splurge on real Italian cheese and use it sparingly - again, the idea is to enhance the dish, not overwhelm it.",2011-02-04T16:57:53Z,2011-02-04T16:57:53Z

I used 1/2 cup rye flour along with the bread flour;  I used the KAF pumpernickel instead of whole wheat and added 1/2 cup raisins and 2 T caraway seeds.  (Those of us who have made bread for years can't leave well enough alone can we?) I couldn't believe how well the dough raised!  Have never read about your method of rising for 40 minutes then stretching and folding, but I followed those directions and it works very well - am interested in the reasoning behind this ---<br/>I turned my oven down halfway through as it was going too quickly, but that's a small adjustment.

Who knows if either this recipe or the one Chef #1520765 gives are really Chipotle's - at a minimum - the ratios are all wrong for this recipe.  I have a guac. recipe with similar ingredients but different ratios; mine is a good recipe, but definitely not Chipotle's.  I thought that maybe these ratios would make my recipe better - NO!  I used red onion, and only one serrano (only had one); It was too salty, and there was way too much cilantro & onion.  I love garlic, but it ruined this guac (I'm now convinced garlic does not belong in guac).  After tasting this disaster, I added two more avocados to help dilute the onion, cilantro, salt, etc... - I probably needed to add ten more.

I don't use tumeric much and I was worried that hubby wouldn't like the recipe. I was also a little frustrated with the instructions as written. The meatball ingredients are listed first but the instructions launch into the vegetable instructions saying to ""add all the other ingredients"". A newbie cook could easily get confused! Also in #4 it says to cook on low presumably in the oven. I'm not familiar with ""low"" in the oven so I just cooked at 350F which is a standard baking temp. Also as I'm now seeing your picture, I see you sliced the carrots, the instructions say diced carrots, peeled and sliced. So I diced the carrots. No harm done... they still tasted fine. <br/>I live in the US where we don't default to metric but luckily I have a scale which converts. I used the full amount of carrots but only had about 500g of green beans. I told DH that it was supposed to have more but he said he liked the porportions that I made.<br/>With the above complaints I was tempted to give it 3 stars but was surprised and pleased with the actual recipe. It was very easy to throw together and felt very ""healthy"" because of all the vegetables. In the past, DH has not been a big meatball fan but he said he liked them because they didn't dry out. I didn't have anything to serve it with except white rice... I think that flatbread would be the ideal choice. I still may try the original recipe one time to see which I want to make on an ongoing basis. Thanks for posting!

Not having access to it, I searched for a clone.  I chose this recipe because it was noted to be gluten free and I love the story of your traditional Thanksgiving celebrations.

Also the baking powder could be increased to 2 tsp and the salt reduced to 1 tsp.  You might try not melting the butter, but bringing it to room temperature and then cutting it into the flour/dry ingredient mixture, then add the wet ingredients and mix.

We are not allwed milk or eggs, so I subbed a banana for the egg and coconut milk beverage for the milk. We even added chocolate chips to make them sweeter, but it did not help.

I loved this pie, I made up the filling, put most of it in 4 single pie crusts, I ran out of flour, the rest went into a pie plate to freeze and to be put in a pie crust later. I made up one tonight for dessert with a crumb topping and it was yummy, the filling stayed together, didn't run all over the plate. The only changes I made is I used ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice instead of just nutmeg and putting in into pie crusts. I will top then when I pick up some more flour. I can't wait to eat it again. I made another batch of this with gala apples, I used the full amount of cinnamon and nutmeg but added 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice to the mixture. The filling tasted awesome. This time I got 6 pies. Four are topped with crusts 1 with crumb topping, the last one with crumb topping but with added oatmeal.<br/><br/>I just baked one, 375 F for 1 hr and 10 minutes.

I used a standard 1/2 oz. stainless steel disher (Pampered Chef small scoop) which produced exactly 5 & 1/2 dozen cookies.  I also substituted baking powder for the cream of tartar as suggested by another member.  The cookies turned out perfect.  Because I used a baking stone instead of a cookie sheet, I could not chill the stone between batches (that would take forever).  I used parchment paper on a chilled cutting board to portion the batches out.  I allowed the stone to cool for 2-3 minutes between batches while the previous batch of cookies cooled on their parchment sheet on the counter before I removed them to a cooling rack.  I then transferred the parchment sheet with the new batch to the hot stone just moments before putting it in the oven.  This kept the dough cool until the moment it went into the oven.

I really couldn't even tell it was in there.  I love bacon and that was the main reason I wanted to try it.  The black beans were a nice change from the regular kidney beans though.  The spices were nice and it had a very hearty flavor.  However, I felt that the work and time I put into it, didn't pay out in the end.  It was good, but I was expecting it to be great based on reviews as well as ingredients.  I thought the avocado was a GREAT addition to it though.  It provided a different texture to the chili that I really liked.  I asked my husband who's very critical of my cooking if he liked it and he said ""YES, but it tastes just like the chili you normally make.""

I'm usually hesitant to make anything that has to simmer on the stove because I overcook it, but the pork chops stayed really moist (we used boneless) even when I had to let them cook for an extra 10 minutes because I forgot to put the noodles on to cook. I then mixed 1/4 c cold water and 1 Tbsp cornstarch and added it to the juice in the pan (after I removed the pork chops) and continued boiling until it thickened for a sauce to put over the chops. My family wound up drizzling it over everything on their plates because it was so good. Also, I didn't have smoked chops so I added 2-3 drops of liquid smoke seasoning to give it the extra kick. It was fantastic, but I think it would be even better with the smoked chops and I will try this next time. Thank you for posting! This one is a keeper!",2011-02-07T17:52:38Z,2011-02-07T17:52:38Z

1189787,131018,299575,Cat from Charlotte,5,"I've made this twice, and follow the recipe nearly exactly. I buy and use a single 20 ounce bottle of Canada Dry ginger ale, instead of just the one cup. After draining the crockpot, removing the fat and shredding the meat, I like to add a cup or two of a vinegar-based barbecue sauce to keep the pork moist without making it too sweet. Then I add enough Sweet Baby Ray's (or occasionally other sauce) to get it to the perfect consistency.<br/><br/>I made this for our SuperBowl party yesterday, starting off with a 6.5lb Boston Butt pork shoulder. It was JUST enough to feed 18 people with side dishes and other things included. We all got at least one good sandwich. The recipe was met with raves. It's a winner because you only have to spend about 20-30 ""active"" minutes on it (removing the fat and shredding the pork) and it will keep from 1 hour to 8 hours on low after you've prepared it for serving. It doesn't get dry, it just gets more tender!",2011-02-07T17:58:04Z,2011-02-07T17:58:04Z

Better than Chinese takeout, because I control the ingredients, I really pump up the veggie quotient (one whole onion, one large green pepper and 3 carrots, all diced) and fry these babies up. My family never asks for Chinese buffet anymore and for that I'm glad! I'd like to mention that getting the consistency just right was really important to me.

I've never seen that done with carbonara and it seemed like too much trouble, so I just beat the whole egg. That said, I still wasn't happy with this recipe. It may be authentic, but I won't be making it again without some adjustments. The ingredients are fine, and although I admit to preferring melted butter to olive oil in this, I used extra virgin olive oil.  I used bacon instead of pancetta, and maybe that's where I made a mistake. Even though it was lean bacon, all that bacon grease was just too much. And the next time, I'd wait before adding the pasta cooking liquid; it may not need it. I ended up with a greasy, soupy mess when I was expecting a nice, glossy coating on the pasta.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars because I didn't want to discourage anyone else from trying it, but I would recommend leaving the oil out of the saute pan and adding it to the egg (or egg white, if you're going to do that). And definitely drain the fat from the cooked bacon. A little fat left in the pan is fine, but I had 4 or 5 tablespoons of bacon fat on top of the 3 tablespoons of oil. And reserve the cooking water in case you need it, but don't add it unless your pasta is too dry.<br/><br/>The other proportions are perfect. Not too much bacon, just enough cheese, and one egg per person. It's easy to adjust the number of servings. And only six ingredients. Served with a salad or a green vegetable and a blush wine, it's a great weeknight dinner.",2011-02-08T02:48:27Z,2011-02-08T02:48:27Z

I did make my noodles seperate so I can add it in just before dinner to warm through.  I used a combination of acini de pepe and ditalini noodles. Ialso used homemade broth left over from the turkey cooking to reduce as much salt as possible and added in an extra clove of garlic and NO salt seasoning.  This is a keeper.

I would recommend using a coarse chop for the onion rather than simply quartering--my food processor didn't handle it well and I had to fish out huge chunks of onion when I was making the patties.

1190045,221973,1820947,lisa97225,4,"These are really good.  I'm only taking off one star because the recipe is not well written and you kind of need to improvise.  It doesn't give the amount of pizza dough to start with.  It tells you to melt the butter and mix together the other ingredients (one of which is the parmesan), then later tells you to sprinkle with parmesan, so I assume you leave the parmesan out of step 4.  It mentions tossing them in the butter mixture and letting them ""soak,"" but you cannot ""soak"" this many knots in that amount of butter.  It also says to toss in butter again after sprinkling with cheese - which would just remove the cheese.  So...if you just take this as a list of ingredtients, and then do what seems logical, you'll end up with some yummy garlic knots.  Just don't try to follow the recipe.  :)",2011-02-06T21:49:51Z,2011-02-06T21:49:51Z

The second time around, I added less than one tsp of the chicken bubillion and no salt until after I had tasted the final product. I'm not a big onion fan, but I do appreciate the flavor they can give a dish. I chopped up only about a 1/4-1/2 a cup of onion and that was muuuch better.

1190109,107621,158591,Timedess,5,"So I've been gleaning from this site for several years now, and have never posted a review before. BUT, this pie was SO good, I'm ""coming out of lurkdom"" to give it yet another 5-star rating. Out of 11 people in my family, it gets 11 ""thumbs-up"". I topped it with sweetened whipped cream (cause I was in a sweets-making mood last night so had it made up for another recipe), and we used a different pie crust recipe just because that's the one my son is used to using. Our pies came out darker even though we did use the food coloring, because I only use turbinado sugar and it is naturally brown. I've noted our copy of the recipe so we won't waste food coloring again. I also didn't have any cornstarch, so we used flour instead (the conversion for that is 2x as much flour as cornstarch called for); this worked just fine.

I also used an additional 1/4 t. of fresh Rosemary (only cause I love the flavor). Brushed the top with unsalted butter the last 10 minutes. Cheddar disappears and serves only as a binder.

I tried to figure out what it was on my own, but to no avail. The recipe makes a TON of sauce and calls for way too much onion, so I would recommend cutting the whole recipe in half and only using 1/4 of an onion. Also, it turned out very very bitter. I added a little sugar as I have to tomato sauces in the past, but it still needed something more. Then added some oregano which helped but didnt fix it.

My 7 yr old ate it & he rarely eats dinner with us. Everyone liked it! I added mushrooms too & poured the mixture on top of egg noodles. I actually doubled the sauce, but wasn't really necessary because the recipe makes a pretty good amount of sauce.

She has to spend most of her day with them, and doesn't have a lot of time to prepare a meal for us without hearing the words, ""Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy..."", at least a hundred times. You get the picture. I prepared a hot bubble bath for her and lit a few candles, with a brand new copy of ""Woman's Day"", to keep her busy for at least an hour. Then I laid the kids' down for a short nap and headed to the kitchen as excited as child on Christmas morning. I didn't have the mushrooms for this meal, but everything else was there. She is a great wife and mom, with a very stocked and organized pantry. I didn't have to search for a thing. The chops came out crunchy and juicy at the same time. Perfect on the top and bottom. I put the oven on broil for the last minute or so, just to make the top crunchy (learned that from baking pizza). The side dishes I used were broccoli and cheese rice, and whole sweet carrots with a dash of brown sugar. Also I made some slaw from one of my mothers recipes to go with it.

My only exposure to clam chowder was while visting in Maine and New Hampshire during the winter one year. The chowder I enjoyed the most was thick, creamy and had a fair amount of potatoes. So that is why I started with this recipe. I read other reviews and incorporated some of their suggestions.<br/><br/>I doubled the amount of canned clams. I was concerned that the extra amount of clam juice would make the soup to thin, but that was not the case. It really brought out a nice clam flavor.<br/><br/>I added two stalks of chopped celery to add little more texture variation. I also added a couple of cloves of garlic.<br/><br/>But the thing I added that really topped off my variation was 8oz of cream cheese. Of course, I'm sure that clam chowder purists abhore the idea of canned cream of celery soup, canned clams and cream cheese, but it works really, really well.

I was a little shy of a whole tablespoon of lemon zest, as my gingerbread called for a teaspoon, but I had an extra tablespoon of juice from my 2 lemons, so I threw it in. It had a perfectly lemony flavor, and the touch of ginger was very nice. I did use an extra half-tablespoon of cornstarch. I couldn't wait for it to cool, and it seemed a little thin. (The leftover sauce will probably thicken up quite nicely in the fridge.)<br/><br/>I felt compelled to add a dash of salt. (I salt practically everything.) And at the end, I stirred in 2 T. of butter for a velvety finish. It was already good without it, but butter adds a little extra something to the texture.<br/><br/>I loved the method of bringing everything to a boil and then adding the cornstarch. Like making a simple syrup, it allowed the sugar to dissolve into the liquid, and allowed me the chance to correct any flovors that might not have been right, which, of course, there weren't.<br/><br/>Maybe someday, I'll make the souffle.

1190320,168780,1799495,44helen44,5,"This new year I resolved to follow a healthier diet.  So to avoid any added sugar, processed table salt, preservatives and additives, I've been learning how to make some of the foods I normally eat, like yoghurt.  The first time I tried this recipe, I made the mistake of heating the milk on high heat so it burned on the bottom of the saucepan.  The second mistake that I made was that I didn't mix the room temperature plain yoghurt ""starter""/added milk into the cooled milk.  I just added it without mixing it.  The third (!) mistake I made was that I didn't leave the light on in the oven (for low heat) so my first attempt at making Greek yoghurt was an utter failure!  The second time I tried, I heated the milk in a double boiler.  I also looked at the yoghurt recipe in Joy of Cooking and it said to heat the milk to 180 degrees F.  I couldn't find my yoghurt thermometer so I used a candy thermometer.  I waited a long time and the milk only heated up to about 170 degrees F.  It wouldn't heat higher than that in the double boiler (according to the candy thermometer).  I decided to go with this and proceeded to let the milk cool down.  This time I also stirred in the yoghurt starter/milk mixture, then wrapped up the bowl in a large thick warm towel and left it in the oven with the light on.  The recipe in the Joy of Cooking cookbook said that if yoghurt was used as a starter, it should only take 3 to 4 hours to solidify;  and that if a starter was used, it would take 8 hours or more.  I checked my yoghurt at 6 hours and it was done enough.  Only a small amount of liquid was present.  It is very creamy and tasty.  I have some every morning with my breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!<br/><br/>Further to the review I wrote on Jan 19, I am still making this yoghurt every few days.  I drain it to the consistency of whipped cream.  If you heat the milk in a double boiler with the lid on, it should take about 20 minutes to reach 180 degrees F.  To cool it down to 110 degrees F it takes about 45 minutes (with the lid off) and on a trivet.  I eat this yoghurt every morning sprinkled with Hemp Hearts (an excellent source of protein, fiber and healthy oils).  When I crave something sweet, I eat some with a little bit of raw natural honey mixed in.  I'm addicted!",2011-02-09T07:36:15Z,2011-02-09T07:36:15Z

It's been real chilly here, certainly not as cold as it was for you when you created this recipe, but enough that a hot, healthy soup cooking in the crock pot made the house feel even warmer and more inviting.  I soaked my dried navy beans overnight and then just added them to the crock pot without pre-cooking.  I had orange, yellow and green peppers, so I used some of each and I left out the mushrooms.  I used the rice option to make this gluten free, but I put it in too early for my newest crock pot that cooks everything in half the time (always on low).  We were eating a very early dinner (3pm) because we wouldn't be home til after 10pm, so I thought the rice would be fine.  I ended up adding a second helping of rice about 2pm.

I removed them from the skillet, leaving a little bacon drippings and added about 2 T of butter. I proceeded with the recipe from that point on, except at the end of the cooking time I added about 1 teaspoon of malt vinegar (red wine vinegar would work also) and a twist of red  pepper flakes from the grinder, then tossed to serve. I served this with leftover BBQ baby back ribs and a side of red beans and rice (with chicken andouille sausage).  The volume reduced dramatically, with the 16 oz. bag of cole slaw reduced to a finished 2 cups or so.  It served 2 very well.  My husband loves cabbage, especially if the recipe includes bacon and vinegar.  I tolerate cabbage, but I must say this was a wonderfully simple recipe, and very tasty.",2011-02-08T20:30:16Z,2011-02-08T20:30:16Z

Instead of portioning them right away, I make a triple batch and let the dough rise (after the initial 10 minute rest) refrigerated. Then I portion and gently roll them right before the baking soda bath. I let them rise after boiling them for as long as I can (sometimes I have to put them in the oven right away, they turn out quite nicely) and then bake them. (NOTE: There's no need to score these-- if you roll them gently before you boil them, they'll take on that lovely marbled look.) I bake them at 400 because they had a tendency to burn on the bottom, but that might just be my commercial oven. These are definitely worth the work (though I highly recommend the use of a kitchenaid mixer), and once you take a deep breath and just try it they get easier each time. I could make these from start to finish with my eyes closed.. and even after baking hundreds of 'em my mouth waters every time a take a batch from the oven. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I also chilled a piece of wax paper to roll out the dough between, needless to say - it still got sticky real fast and I used this dough straight out of the freezer. I didn't add any extra flour while rolling it out - so I just may try a sprinkle of flour between wax paper next time. I used this to make Apple Strudel, it was buttery, flaky, delicious. I am definitely making this again - thanks for sharing!",2011-02-09T16:17:38Z,2011-02-09T16:17:38Z

1190588,400909,705251,HokiesMom,3,This is very easy to prepare but I found it to be way too greasy in the end.  I definitely think the amount of butter needs reduced by half and the oil to be omitted.  My kids and I found it to be lacking in a depth of flavor - the addition of pepper is a must for us for sure - not a huge amount but enough to give it some more seasoning.  You definitely need to spray your crockpot well before making and even then there were hot spots that were over-cooked even with it being in the crock for only a bit over 3 hours.  Generally crockpots really vary in temperature so I suggest definitely watching this dish closely after 2.5 to 3 hours which makes it hard to cook while away at work.

1190620,202341,269575,zainab23,5,"I really liked this recipe. The best thing was that the koftas didn't break apart during deep frying like a lot of other kofta recipes do. I didn't add baby spinach leaves to the koftas because I didn't have any. I added only a very small amount of water to the mix (with too much water I think they might fall apart), then I refrigerated the balls a few hours before frying (which might have helped to keep them together). I made the sauce nearly as directed but I pureed the tomato first and used 2 tomatoes rather than one and I fried the whole spices then the onion, ginger and garlic, then the powdered spices, then finally I added the pureed tomato and fried it until the water of the tomato reduced and the tomato became golden (to cook the tomato [which gives a nice flavour through the dish]). The sauce tasted good as it was, but then I added a teaspoon of tomato paste and a little cream and half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce and that also made it nice (I wanted the koftas to taste like malai kofta a dish from indian restaurants). Next time I want to add a few sultanas to the kofta mix as well, which I think would be nice. As is the koftas taste cheesy and spicy (without a flour or egg taste which is very good). I will definitely put this on my rotation as dish for when I feel like eating malai kofta.",2011-02-10T02:50:34Z,2011-02-10T02:50:34Z

I did make these using 5 slices of gluten-free bread (5 cause they are much smaller than regular wheat bread). I would recommend getting the lentil mixture fairly thick in the cooking process and definitely allow the resting/cooling times mentioned. I think perhaps making slightly smaller patties would make them a little easier to flip while cooking. Perfect for serving with a salad and the yogurt and mango chutney really gave them a flavour lift. I think these probably would freeze well if you wanted half now and half to cook later.

I also discovered that you can order dehydrated chopped veggies from Frontier coop (Iowa, I think). I only buy groceries once a month, so these are big money and time savers for me. Frontier also sells tomato powder and cheese powder. So there's more you can add to the list of recipes. I also make my own gravy mixes, white sauce mix, seasoning mixes (onion, taco, greek, ranch dressing, Italian dressing, etc.) I am also making the homemade version of H--- Helper, mac & cheese, rice-a-r---,pasta-r---,  etc. They taste better and I know what the ingredients are. Frontier sells a lot of products that are organic, too. I used to make chocolate, vanilla & butterscotch pudding mixes but no kids around now. Of course there's also the hot chocolate, mocha, spiced tea mixes, etc. A vacuum sealer is of great help in this process and successfully keeps the humidity out of the packets. I started making mixes in the 80's when I was in nursing school and had 4 little ones and a tight budget. It's a passion that has grown for me. Don't let me forget the wonderful buttermilk pancake & waffle mix using dried buttermilk. Someone also sells pure maple syrup granules that you can make into syrup or use in baked goods. There's also vanilla powder and dried eggs that can go in mixes. Let your imagination go - there's probably a recipe or you can make one up!",2011-02-10T05:32:33Z,2011-02-10T05:32:33Z

Oh also I did not have any regular cider on hand so I used apple cider instead and I did not taste any difference. We all loved it.,2011-02-10T11:01:14Z,2011-02-10T11:01:14Z
1190668,404945,1436160,GibbyLou,4,Made this for our dinner last night.  DH and I really enjoyed it.  It had a bit more spice than I like in this type of soup.  I would try half the pepper the next time I make it. It also took longer than 15 minutes to carmelize the onion and it still didn't get particularly brown.  I used french bread and gruyere for the topping.  Thanks for posting.,2011-02-10T11:05:31Z,2011-02-10T11:05:31Z

1190678,135272,1823578,asmooch22,0,Just a cooking tip to those who are saying that their fish came out soggy.  Try putting the fish or anything that you have dredged in flour/breadcrumbs in the refrigerator for at least an hour before you go ahead and cook it.  This allows time for the coating to stick to the item to help create more crispiness in the oven while cooking!!!!,2011-02-09T17:21:25Z,2011-02-09T17:21:25Z

Instead of puttin it in a blender i took a potato masher and mashed the potatoes in the pot to the thickness that i wanted.  I also added broccoli and put bacon bits in the soup.  It was very easy.  It tasted great, i didnt have the thyme so i didnt miss it. Thank you so much for posting this.  The fried potato skins were awesome and a great addition.  My son came home and ate it 4 hours later and had to reheat it, and he said it was excellent.. It is easy from the directions, can be made with real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon to make it go faster, you just have to have bacon grease on hand to complete it.  I also added some milk along with the cream and added extra chicken broth to make more and it was fantastic.  Thanks again. Will definitely make again.",2011-02-10T10:29:52Z,2011-02-10T10:29:52Z

I did let mine rise longer but only because I had the time while I prepared the rest of dinner!  I got 12 regular size buns (once they rised).  I was thinking they would be more slider size (not a big deal for my family).  I will try this recipe will full amount of sugar and try for cinnamon rolls!  I will let you know how they turn out!!  Thanks!! UPDATE:  I couldn't wait so I got up this morning and made the recipe as Cinnamon Rolls.  I used the entire amount of sugar but still kept the oil at 3T.  I rolled the dough into a rectangle, poured about 1/2 c melted butter, then sprinkled generously with sugar and cinnamon.  I rolled up and cut, put in oiled dish and let rise for about 10-15 minutes then baked at 375 for about 15-20 minutes.  Topped with cream cheese icing!  YUMMY!!  Only took about an hour and 15 minutes start to finish!  I also got about 23 rolls out of dough.

I bet it's fabulous with the strawberries, but I used raspberries instead, and only 15 of them (to cut carbs so I could drink the whole thing myself). This made more of a smoothie-like consistency rather than a thicker ice cream-type consistency. But it was freakin' awesome as a smoothie. And the entire recipe was only 4.37 net carbs done this way - I slurped it all up myself and moaned with pleasure as I did so. I used DaVinci white chocolate syrup (sugar free of course)...wonderful combination. Thanks for the awesome recipe Grandma Pat!",2011-02-10T15:35:42Z,2011-02-10T15:35:42Z

I used a thick creamy Cesar dressing in place of ranch, spread it on the tortilla to help stick the edges together after rolling. I crammed as many veggies on the four tortilla I had on hand. The trick it to slice stuff up as thin as possible.  *red onions, avocado sliced, romaine, seedless cukes,  slices of cheddar, chicken, crumbled blue cheese and LOADS of bacon. Hold the tomatoes, there wasn't any room! This definitely requires a fork & knife YUM!  Thanks Lazyme!",2011-02-10T19:34:20Z,2011-02-10T19:34:20Z

I found the first meal was more stoup then soup even with adding extra broth, and my leftovers were casserole. If I made this again I might use part italian sausage, for extra flavor and more onion and garlic, even though I already added more garlic.  Be cautious when cooking the pasta as everything else started to stick, I turned down the heat but then it took a bit longer for the pasta to cook. Next time I would cook the pasta seperately then add it to the broth to prevent this and maybe help with keeping it more soupy.

This is it.  <br/><br/>I used a cast iron skillet that I heated on the stove and greased with shortening.

I also did not have the ketjap manis so I skipped it. I've never used ketjap manis before but think it might add a bit more depth of flavor next time. If you are going to make this recipe I would probably recommend not adding the meat until you are just about ready to serve as it will continue to cook when you take it off the heat.

I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and subbed brown sugar for half of the regular sugar. Sorry, I forgot to roll the cookies in the sugar before baking. After removing from the oven I lightly sprinkled each cookie with sugar. Would have used raw sugar but I was all out. As others did, I also made the familiar crisscross pattern with a fork. An oiled cookie scoop was helpful in handling and shaping the dough. My daughter and I enjoyed baking these and they are simple and quick which is a big plus when you're cooking with a toddler.

The coating starting clumping up and coming off in the pan during the last part. Maybe I left it in there too long or had the heat up too high. I'll probably attempt sesame chicken again, but not with this specific recipe only because I want to find one closer to our favorite take out food, but thanks for submitting a tasty recipe.",2011-02-10T22:23:13Z,2011-02-10T22:23:13Z

I just happened to have everything for this recipe. Since I only had one fillet I just guessed on the measurements. I am gluten intolerant so I changed a couple of the ingredients. I used corn flour instead and I used amino acids for soy sauce (tastes the same but gf, and is waaaaay better for you). I added some syrup to the sauce mixture with the honey and soy sauce, just for a little more flavor. I also added some lemon pepper to the flour mixture. I toasted the almonds and follwed the rest of the recipe to a ""T"". The flavor was incredible. So d%$# good.

The mouth-feel of this dish was right, but it was just so bland. I think I could do better by making my own sweet and sour sauce and spicing it up with red-pepper flakes for flavor.<br/><br/>Now, I don't think the whole recipe is rubbish. The marinade and the preparation of the beef was decent, and it serves to inspire me on other Chinese inspired beef dishes. <br/><br/>So while this dish has a lovely appearance, and offered some lessons in Chinese style beef preparation, on a whole, this was one of the most bland dishes I had ever tasted",2011-02-11T04:25:11Z,2011-02-11T04:25:11Z

I enjoyed it the first time I made it but had trouble preparing it in my bread machine.  It was almost impossible to get out of my machine and (my machine has a horizontal pan) both paddles became very stuck inside the loaf.  So, I decided to try taking the dough from the machine and finishing it in the oven.  Also, I read some of the suggestions regarding coconut flour and salt so I replaced half the soy flour with coconut flour and added 1/4 tsp of salt for a 1.5# loaf.  When the dough is ready I gently pull it out of the machine's pan, punch it down, shape it and place it in a loaf pan.  Bake it for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven and then let it cool 30 minutes before removing it from the pan.  It is totally awesome and has a texture not unlike ""regular"" bread.

I do not think I would care to use white flour after tasting these.  The batter was quite easy to mix up. Parchment paper seems a must.  I did not have any and had to remove my crackers from the pan with a some scrapping.  The graham crackers are crisp and tasty.  Perfect for little ones learning to chew!

I wanted to make a pound cake without needing to use a ridiculous amount of ingredients like with most other pound cake recipes (budget is extra tight right now, need to cut back wherever possible) and this just might become my favorite pound cake recipe! It is significantly sweeter than a traditional pound cake, but that means it's perfect to snack on just as it is without adding anything at all to it. I made some petit fours with it and it's a bit too sweet for that, I think, once paired up with the sweetness of the frosting. But plain this is fabulous! It's nice and moist, not as dense as a typical pound cake which I happen to light a lot. I didn't have a ""crust"" on top like another reviewer did - I think maybe the cake was a bit over baked for that to happen.

Substituted sunflower seeds with pumpkin seeds, doubled the amout of dates, used only 1/4 cup sugar (because the dates are sweet enough). As per another suggestion, I substituted corn syrup with honey and the honey with tahini. DELICIOUS. A bit crumbly but I think it's almost impossible not to have it like that unless you use marshmellow or some other sugar that hardens. <br/>Tip: to coarsly chop the nuts, I throw them in a mortar and bash them a few times.

The only thing I'd do differently would be to cut down on the braggs a bit if using marmite as well...mainly because the stock I use is salted too.  Thanks Prose, very good!

Now with my dressing, I added a little dill (cause it goes great with fish) and garlic powder just because I love it. And with my relish, well it really wasn't a relish. I just chopped up a cucumber, a tomato, red onion, avocado, lettuce and kept it all on the side so that my family could pick and choose what they wanted to put on the taco(which by the way I used muli grain wraps)Oh and I didn't use any salsa cause we didn't have any in the house.

1191100,425478,293924,Lovellama,4,"Thoughts on this cookie after making them: the dough was all crumbs after I mixed it until I took a handful at a time and kneaded it together into a ball.  It was rather dry and stiff, it might need another egg.  After chilling it was very stiff and hard to work.  I used a tablespoon sized cookie scoop to scoop out the dough, then rolled it between my hands to warm it to get it soft.  After it was a smooth ball I flattened it between my hands.  They cooked for 12 min at 400 degrees.  They looked like molasses crinkles, cracked on the top.  They did spread, I had about 15 to a sheet.  The yield was 80 cookies or 6.5 dozen.<br/><br/>Next time I might use melted butter and not chill the dough.  Apparently they are supposed to be rolled out thin and cut like gingerbread men, but with the way this recipe is, that wasn't going to happen.  Hand rolling them was the only way I cold do it.

I used spelt flour and added an additional 1/2 cup of 12 grain cereal from bulk barn and 1/4 cup flax seeds so I needed to add an extra few tbsp of water.  I also added about 1-1/2 tsp of garlic and onion powder.  I didn't broil them at all, I just skipped that step and went straight to boiling.  I also didn't brush them with anything cause I didn't want the outside crispy at all.  I made 8, since breaking the dough into 9 evenly was a pain, but they were quite large, so next time I think I'll split it into 10 and see how small they are, but I think that will be the perfect size for lunch or a snack.

Also pour out Ranch a little at a time so if you don't use it all you don't have to toss it because raw chicken was in it. Easy cleanup using foil too.

This made 12 rounded muffins for me that were done after 18 minutes. They were moist without being goopy.

1191123,385071,171790,Dreamer in Ontario,5,These were a hit at dinner tonight. I ended up making 12 because there was too much potato to fit into 8 muffin cups. I grated a bit more cheese and sliced a third green onion for the extra 4 potato gratins. I also didn't end up using 3/4 cup of cream. I just poured a bit over each assembled muffin tin without measuring the amount but I would guess that each muffin tin got a couple of tablespoons of cream.

I couldn't find HP Steak Sauce in my local grocery stores, so I used the U.S. equivalent (according to the internet) of A-1 Steak Sauce.  And I wasn't quite sure what beef bovril powder is, and that mystery wasn't exactly solved even after an internet search.  I decided to use beef bouillon powder, and it seemed to work well.

Reading online, I understand it is hard or maybe impossible to find real salep powder outside of Turkey, so since I do not reside in Turkey and I imagine with regards to what I read online the fake stuff would probably contain corn starch I used potato starch and added a splash of Iranian rose water (Iranian part being my preference) after heating since I also understand the powder to be aromatic like a flower and lightly taste of a flower.

1191169,179035,646093,qotw13,3,"With a few tweaks, these could be pretty tasty. I made these the other night, with only a couple changes: one whole egg, 2 T canola oil instead of the oil and applesauce called for (I wanted to use butter, but didn't have any that wasn't frozen, lol), and added a t of vanilla, and about 1/2 t almond extract. I also sprinkled the tops with sugar before putting them in the oven. The texture of these muffins is pretty good, but they had very little flavor. I was very glad I put the sugar on top, because that definitely helped. Next time, I will use butter, and probably add a bit more sugar and extracts. Oh, and I also soured the milk with lemon juice instead of vinegar, and I ended up with 11 muffins, rather than 13. Will probably make these again in the future.",2011-02-12T00:23:18Z,2011-02-12T00:23:18Z

Poured the sauce over (used a basil and tomato one by Jensens) after cooking as directed and I added 2 cloves of garlic and about 2 teaspoons of freshly chopped sweet basil for 4 chicken breasts, spooned the sauce on and baked for the 30 minutes (think they would have been dried out if I had pounded out) {oops forgot the butter}, then I added some grated 4 cheese pizza mix and topped with some sliced mozzarella and popped back in the oven (160C fan forced).  The chicken came out moist and I and the DS thoroughly enjoyed (the DM declared she wasn't hungry and refused to eat) and the DH thought that the sauce tasted to raw tomatoes wise.  Will certtainly give another go but will have to try another sauce (not easy finding any that don't have onion in them as the DH is intolerant to it and unfortunately can no long get Jensens Tomato and Mushroom sauce which had no onion and which I always used to make my parmigiana, bolegnese and lasagna - the tomato and basil good in the last two but the parmigiana is the challenge now).

I kept the heads on my shrimps, purely because (according to better cooks than me) it adds to the end flavour. (In South Africa shrimps, better known as prawns, are almost always served shell and head on, and the best tasting ones come from Mozambique. In this case those were not available, and I used Indian farmed prawns which are fairly tastless! But I did peel the bodies). Your sauce cannot be faulted. The balance of flavours is perfect. I did add a little water when simmering the sauce, purely because I think I had more shrimp than your specified 1 lb, and the sauce was not quite enough. I made brown basmati rice, and not white rice. This was a delicious meal, and I cannot understand why your recipe has so far gone unnoticed!!  Thanks for posting, we had a delicious dinner!

1191283,391163,400708,Bonnie G 2,5,Here's another 5 star review to add to this awesome bread.  Made it to go with a bean soup and it's probably one of the easiest breads I've ever made with such an outstanding result my 3 year old DGD even helped me make it.  Great crusty outside with a light soft crumb inside.  The only thing I did differant (and it was minimal) was prior to baking brush the crust with an egg white wash and top with a mixed bread topping.  It was awesome and enjoyed by everyone.,2011-02-12T15:12:08Z,2011-02-12T15:12:08Z
1191284,403421,400708,Bonnie G 2,5,"OMG, these are soooo good.  You are right about that ""unexpected snap"".  This went together so easy that my DGS made them by himself, the surprising part is that he's one boy who SWEARS he HATES pepper and won't try anything that even has a small suspicious speck in it.  Even after making this himself and knowing the pepper was in it - he declared them the BEST cookie ever.  Sort of soft on the inside with that nice crunch on the outside.  We made added red sugar to the topping as we wanted to serve at our Valentine bar-b-q.  The one suggestion I'd make is if using a powder sugar sifter to apply that dusting, use regular pepper for that part as the fresh ground would not go through our sieve.  But that is OK, we got our ""snap"" from what was inside the cookie.  DGS has taken this recipe home so he can make it again.  2010 update:  These little gems where so good last year, made them again this year for are holiday tray.",2011-02-12T15:15:34Z,2011-02-12T15:15:34Z

The taste is just right - not to sweet, good crunch (we like the chunks) and has so many possibilities.  The only change I made was to use chopped walnuts.  Think I might add coconut next time.  I made this with the intention of serving with my morning yogurt but the whole family have been snacking on it all day so it may not last - even my picky DGS who says he doesn't like granola.

Instead, I small cubed 8 ounces of mozzarella. I did everything else exactly as stated and it came out really good! In fact, my wife and I think it's the best vegetarian meatloaf we ever had! The consistency came out very close to actual ""carnivore"" meat loaf. The blend of the flavors of the ketchup, mustard and soy sauce was perfect, giving it a bit of a barbecue taste.

You should write a recipe book. I had never heard of table cream, all I had was heavy cream but didn't want to only use that so I used whole milk with the heavy cream and it worked just fine. I had just bought some white pepper to try and it was perfect for this. I also used a mix of parmegiano reggiano and romano cheese. I used fresh flat leaf parsely at the last minute. I poured the sauce over shrimp and mostaccioli pasta. I will definitely do this again and in fact, I can't wait to try it on my daughter and her family when they visit. Great meal for dinner guests.

I used 1/2 muenster and 1/2 sharp cheddar and the parmesan on top. Also I didn't have ricotta or cream cheese so I used sour cream. Other than that I kept it the same though. I think I will use different pasta next time than the egg noodles I used because they got pretty soft after baking. Wagon wheels are a good idea. I added a bit of salt and pepper at the table and it complemented the slight sweetness of the squash perfectly. DH and I both went back for seconds and my toddler loved it too.

1191368,390157,705251,HokiesMom,5,Another winner by Deantini here!!  The only slight change was I used two whole eggs as I just automatically cracked both into the batter without stopping and thinking.  These are so moist and really fully of nice flavor.  My son devoured them.  I think when I make them again I'm going to reduce the sugar just a bit like Lalaloula suggested just to try to help keep the sugar content down as the bananas were so sweet on their own.

I beat the eggs in a small bowl before adding to the batter which made it easier  to incorporate them. Baked the cake in a round, 24cm in diameter, tin and it rose up wonderful making every slice look that much better. In the baking tin I put parchment paper and had no trouble at all that the cake should stick and be difficult to get out, didn't even grease the paper. Because I baked the cake in a round tin it needed a little more time in the oven. After 48 minutes the cake was baked to perfection.<br/>We are not much for frosting so I left that out, besides, the cake is so rich and moist it does not really need frosting.<br/>This became a special treat!

I prepared this for dinner last night, and the only things I did not do were that I did not cook it in bacon fat (laziness, I did not feel like cooking bacon to get the fat) and I could not find hot paprika, and so settled for just the regular paprika. I like my soups a bit more thick and stew like, so next time I would probably use less water. The amount of dumplings were also a bit slim for us (we ate them all) so next time, I would probably double the dumpling recipe so that our leftovers would also include the tasty dumplings.

1191487,69630,743937,Tinks599,5,"I wanted to make a cake for my husband for Valentines day.  The store did not have white cake, so I used Betty Crocker yellow.  I cut the recipe exactly in half, since this was only for our family.<br/><br/>I miss the 'Champagne' cake I can get in Bakersfield from Smith's bakery where I'm from, so I took inspiration from that.  I don't have a ton of equipment, but I made up for that with the use of parchment paper.  LOL! <br/><br/>I baked one round and one square cake and lined the pans with parchment.  Cut the round in half, arrange the square cake so it looks like a diamond then put each 1/2 circle on the two top sides, making the heart shape.  My long thin bread knife took care of any leveling, but honestly it was minimal.  I didn't have a pan quite large enough for this...but two things made it easy for me to house the cake once together...the bottom of my roasting pan and a small countertop chopping block (in case you are like me and need ideas to enable your cooking!!).  <br/><br/>Once the cake was together, I frosted it with Wilton's Whipped Icing Mix (because I prefer the Whipped topping over buttercreme).  I then sprinkled a little plain cocoa powder over the cake for both color and flavor (I just shook it through my mesh collander), then shaved some Wilton's red melting chips with my cheese grater and sprinkled them on top (I use a Salad Shooter so this took less than a minute and a half to shave all of it).  <br/><br/>I have posted a picture of this.  I do not typically make 'pretty' food...usually just good tasting and baking is particularly difficult for me...following directions and all.  This recipe was EASY to work with and was VERY tasty!!!  I appreciate the use of the box mix approach because the ingredients are all pre-measured and there are plenty of other things I can make from scratch so this very pretty, very very tasty cake was also quite simple and straightforward with just a little patience and a couple hours of my morning.

I tried to use waxed paper instead of parchment because I was out, and didn't like the result. The second set (3rd pan that I didn't have prepared) I greased heavily which worked ok.

1191526,18307,993709,Hey5320,4,"What a simple recipe! So easy to make, tasty too! I will say that I ended up making two different almond butter cookies today (I ran out of cream cheese; and the other recipe didn't have cream cheese on the ingredient list). Of the two, this one was far simpler and quicker to make and the ingredients went further. However, I do think I prefer a more crisp, buttery flavor. This cookie was on the softer side. I used the drop method w/ a red sugar-dipped glass and marishino cherries cut in half for Valentines Day. I will admit I did make larger cookies. The only change I would make for next time would be to roll them into balls before pressing w/ the glass for a neater circle shape. If I hadn't made both cookies in the same day, I probably would have rated this with 5 stars. Thank you for a great recipe Donna!

They were made with the exact ingredients and about the right amounts. The granola I'd say was probably more like 1/2 cup and was homemade. The mixed berries were a mix thawed raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. The other difference was the order of ingredients. The way I had it yogurt was in the bottom, then the fruit and topped with granola. Overall I'm so glad I found this recipe. Thanks for posting a yummy recipe!

This made a beautiful workday lunch- the beans were enough to fill me up, but the lightness of the dressing, greens and shrimp kept me from wanting a post-lunch nap.  The crunchy texture of the celery was a wonderful contrast to the creaminess of the beans.  A snap to put together- it actually took longer to defrost the shrimp than to assemble the dish.  This will make an excellent ""party on the patio"" meal this summer with a refreshing white wine. I made two small changes to the recipe- first I cut it to one serving, second I used baby spring mix instead of arugula.  Definitely a make again!

I heated 2 cups beef stock, red wine and soy sauce, before adding to the mushroom and flour mixture. I found that heating the fluids before adding to butter/flour mixture helps the thickening process, as well as, preventing the taste of flour.  I did add a third tablespoon of soy sauce at the very end.  I made the gravy earlier in the day, by the time I served it later at night, the flavors were intense!!!

I started it in a four quart pot but after adding the 4 cans of chicken broth I decided to put it into an eight quart pot. I used the masa harina instead of tortillas with excellent results. I also tempered the milk before adding it to the pot for fear it might curdle. The remaining soup is in the freezer so I don't know how it will hold up but we'll eat it in a week or two. Since spicyness seems to deminish in the freezer we may need to add some chili powder at serving time. Thanks for a great soup recipe.,2011-02-13T21:07:56Z,2011-02-13T21:07:56Z

1191648,388376,444132,Katzen,4,"This was definately simple to make and came together in a snap!  We did find it dry, though, even with an additional tbsp of olive oil, and felt it needed some acidic flavour, and some crunch, too.  I added a whole fresh squeezed organic lemon, which I'd rolled around on the counter to get every last bit out of, and wished I'd had another.  I think perhaps a finely chopped red pepper would have added some crunch and flavour, too.  This dish has plenty of potential - and we really enjoyed being introduced to pecorino cheese, not to mention that edname beans are a real favourite, but it did lack something.  Perhaps some fresh basil...?  Definately one with good ""bones"", well worth future experimentation.  Thanks so much, nemokitty!!  Made for 1-2-3 Hits!",2011-02-13T22:39:25Z,2011-02-13T22:39:25Z

1191674,412644,1683962,Mrs. Atkins,4,"I made these for a Valentine's day dinner and originally was going to pair it as an appetizer with asparagus and orange roughy. The fish had gone bad, so I actually made these the main course, and luckily the recipe was for 1 lb. so there was plenty for two.<br/><br/>I bought the shrimp deveined. I did my own peeling and then sliced them per the recipe instructions. I wasn't sure how far to go since the recipe said not to slice them all the way through, but when you lay them flat, they don't really make a heart unless the shrimp separates in the middle and stays connected at the ends.<br/><br/>Here's what my Joy of Cooking says (they use the term ""butterfly""): ""Hold so the underside is up. Slice down its length almost to the vein, to form the hinge. Spread and flatten to form the butterfly shape."" (I'll give these instructions a try next time.) There's a little diagram in my edition, so if anyone wants this for reference, let me know and I'll be glad to send it to you, or maybe I could upload it as a photo.<br/><br/>Anyway, to peel, wash, and cut 1 lb. of these took me at least forty minutes, so adjust your times accordingly. Or you can buy the shrimp pre-peeled to save time.<br/><br/>I used a fresh orange from the local farmer's market and a lemon from my tree for the citrus juice. This batter was wonderful.<br/><br/>I don't cook with butter so I used a canola oil substitute from Spectrum. I'm not sure it retains all the health benefits if you melt it down. It certainly did not have the consistency and ease of melting regular butter, but the taste was great.<br/><br/>I had a bit more difficulty with the jam sauce as I couldn't really get it to melt and stay a liquid. As soon as it was off the heat source it started to solidify again like jam and even though I tried heating it again I couldn't really get it to a sauce consistency. You may have better luck using regular butter. But the taste was amazing. I did more of a ""dollop"" than a splatter over the shrimp and it worked fine.<br/><br/>I also realized while cooking that I was actually out of hot sauce, but even if you omit this as I did, it is still wonderful. (I'm sure it would be delicious with a kick added too.)<br/><br/>I would recommend waiting until all the shrimp are arranged on the avocado before heating the sauce so you can put it on while still warm.<br/><br/>Temperature is really key to this recipe, which is the first gourmet appetizer I have made. While the shrimp is cooking, arrange the avocado on the plate. Have all the ingredients for the sauce ready in the pan, then as soon as your done with the avocado, heat your sauce, keeping the shrimp in the oven on ""warm"" if necessary. Once the sauce is ready, quickly put the shrimp on the avocado then dash the sauce and sesame seeds on top, and be sure to serve immediately. (I would not recommend this for a sit-out type of appetizer... much better served on plates to guests while warm.)<br/><br/>Also, one avocado was not really enough for 1 lb. of shrimp. However, since I wasn't eating that much avocado due to dietary restrictions, it worked out to give my husband the full avocado which covered about five shrimp with generous size slices. For the full batch, you might need at least 2-3 avocados, or otherwise cut each slice thinner or in half to double your coverage. However, I like how the full size slice hugged the shrimp hearts. (<>)<br/><br/>The combination of the avocado with the shrimp and sauce is heavenly. A few minutes after eating this I was swooning. :)",2011-02-14T04:24:55Z,2011-02-14T04:24:55Z

We scooped the noodles and poured the soup over them.

1191717,274428,249519,Dories Lori,0,"First of all, I am only talking about the dough, as I did a completely different filling.  That said, the recipe's filling sounds delicious, and I guarantee if you follow the recipe, or even use this dough with another delicious filling, your rugelach will be wonderful!<br/><br/>I made this to compare this sour cream dough with cream cheese dough, and I ended up preferring the cream cheese, due to the more pronounced tang.  Actually, I found this dough fairly plain tasting; I would consider adding a bit more salt and sugar.  (But, do see my following notes...)  <br/><br/>My cooking notes:  When I mixed the dough up,  it did not even come close to forming a ball - way too loose.  I ended up adding another 3/4 (!) cup of flour, to get it to the point where I could form a ball.  (Maybe because I only had ""lite"" sour cream?)  I was nervous, but once chilled, the dough was quite firm, and the rolling went very smoothly.  So, if this happens to you, try to add a lot less flour, even if you have to work with a very loose dough.<br/><br/>The rugelach, as described, would be quite large, and I wanted more smaller ones instead, so I made 8 balls, and tried cutting them into 8s, 10s, and 12s.  Still not sure which was the best proportion, but I will say that the rugelach were still pretty large.<br/><br/>And, like I said, although I personally preferred a cream cheese dough, these rugelach would be very delicious!  Because they're rugelach!",2011-02-12T02:02:18Z,2011-02-12T02:02:18Z

This was my first spelt experience and I must say that the flavor is much lighter and less, um, earthy than doing whole wheat.  Great way to get some whole grains into the diet and the guys all gobbled them up! update: I've made these several times and sometimes they don't come out as good.  I think it has a lot to do w the temperature of the wet ingredient. Warm butter, cold egg and cold milk don't mix!

That's a deal breaker for all people allergic to milk.  Apparently gov't regulations allow it to be technically labelled dairy-free despite the ingredients.  So for those (few, perhaps) allergic to milk, just a word of caution.  There are some powdered soy creamers out there, but I haven't seen any nor have the time now to shop.

I am not sure whether it made a difference or not. . . but I used clear Harris Teeter light corn syrup. because I wanted my candies to be as pale as possible.  I feel that the coconut dough was too wet and needed more coconut, about 16 ounces would probably have been perfect; as I noted in the store that the HT clear was runnier than the Caro.  I also added 1/2 t vanilla and 1/2 t coconut extract.  It is moist and delicious.  This dough was extremely sticky to work with.  I recommend wearing plastic gloves or putting it in a cookie press to fill your molds.  I also think that the dough would have a better texture if the coconut were processed in the food processor.  This is my picture here with the pink chocolates . . . what you cannot see is that the coconut dough weeps through the chocolate at the bottom because it is too wet, but they are fantastic, and I can't recommend white chocolate enough for these!  This is only my first attempt at trying this.   To get it into bars, I had to press out the dough between two silicone pads, freeze, and chop into squares, it was hard to do, but I couldn't work with it room temp except as balls.

Butter needs to be waxy consistency.<br/>And the Butter Cream frosting is missing an ingredient, unsalted BUTTER, one whole pound.<br/>Creme of Coconut 3/4 cup goes in the batter. 1/4 cup goes in the frosting.<br/>Frosting also gets Vanilla & Coconut extract 1 teaspoon each.<br/><br/>I made this for a birthday cake and it turned out beautifully. However, I took this cake in my car and the weather was cold. The cake frosting has so much butter in it, it is very temperature sensitive. Too cold and the butter sets hard and I can imagine that in warm weather the cake would just melt.  Too much butter for me! <br/>The cake part was a little skimpy. It either didn't rise enough or the recipe needs to be increased a bit. It was a little skimpy for splitting into 4 layers and barely made it.

You have to get the whole ""picture"", yes the sauce smells vinegary but once you marry it with the pork and the homemade coleslaw it's magic and amazing, my mouth waters just thinking about it.  The only suggestion that I have is to maybe cut the cayenne pepper in half as it is every part of this recipe, the rub, the mop sauce, bbq sauce and even the coleslaw have cayenne in it or at least seems as if it does.

First of all, this is a really cheap recipe to begin with, and that I love!  But, the recent Taco Bell 35% beef scandal gave me an idea; if they can use 35% beef, why can't I?  <br/><br/>So, I use 1/3 lb of beef, and 2 cups of TVP (textured vegetable protein or vegetarian beef replacement - I find it in the bulk section of WinCo stores) and cook it with the 2 packs ramon seasoning (I use oriental) and about 1 cup of water to hydrate the TVP... when the beef is cooked I add the veggies.  I generally cook 3 packages of ramon for the dish, so the 3rd seasoning packet will usually go in with the noodles while cooking.

My younger daughter and I went searching for a good cookie recipe to use up lots of egg yolks after my older daughter made a double batch of meringues earlier this afternoon.  <br/><br/>These Egg Yolk Cookies are nice and crispy, but also tender.  They were very easy to make with  my six year old baking partner!  I used butter, one stick with salt and one stick without salt.  We added a half of a package of strawberry jello for flavor and pink color, mixing it in with the egg yolks and the vanilla and letting the mixture sit for 5 minutes to allow the gelatin to absorb the liquids-- I didn't have lemon or orange essence on hand, hence the switch in flavoring tactics. They are also pink in honor of Valentine's Day and because it's my younger daughter's favorite color right now!  I doubled the vanilla to 2 tsp to try to keep the same amount of wetness. <br/><br/>We mixed in a bag of white chocolate chips, too at the very end.  Cooking them for 8 minutes was perfect (so that the pink wouldn't become brown).  These cookies are very soft when you first take them out of the oven, but they crunch up nicely after the melted sugar in the mix cools and re-hardens.  The cookies spread slightly, but not as much as I thought that they might.  They still stayed fairly thick.  I would definitely make these again!",2011-02-12T20:35:18Z,2011-02-12T20:35:18Z

Oh, and instead of dry milk, i used half soy milk and the other half, a little more whole wheat flour.<br/><br/>They were delicious right out of the oven!",2011-02-13T22:53:17Z,2011-02-13T22:53:17Z

1191896,429306,280271,teresas,4,These were easy to prepare and really do fall off the bone. I cooked them for 5 1/2 hrs and they were done. I grilled them under the broiler. I used a bold and spicy barbecue sauce and with the spice rub we thought they were a bit over spiced. Next time I would use a less spicy sauce so the flavor of ribs can come through.

1191903,15682,642925,talk2sabby2,2,I was so excited to try this recipe because of the reviews. My husband has an incurable sweet tooth and we all love apples. The cake was ok. We were expecting much more. The Vanilla Butter Sauce was far to sweet even with pure vanilla. Our two other guests didn't like the texture of the cake  or the taste of the sauce. On a scale of one to five they all agreed to one star. I loved the aroma in the kitchen while it was baking and it wasn't that bad. The presentation was beautiful. Sorry but I bake for my husband and he is usually great with the reviews. Cheers.,2011-02-14T10:57:11Z,2011-02-14T10:57:11Z

I combined the dry and wet ingredients and just mixed until combined (did not knead for two minutes).

Mine was definitely spicier than others may turn out as I pounded whole spices with my pestle and mortar until chunky but not powdered besides the ground ginger and allspice I used to replace the nutmeg in a lesser amount, as we do not consume intoxicants.

Also, it was served as the main course, not a side dish.  Another thing that really enhances the flavor is turning the heat up at the end and getting a good crisp on the bottom.  Today I substitute whole wheat egg noodles to enhance the nutrition content.

I followed the recipe to a ""T"" at first, besides adding two cups of cubed ham at the start.  I let it cook for around 9 hours and checked on it.  It was very watery and a tad bit on the bland side (personal preference), so I did some altering.  I took a ladle and scooped out what looked to be about the equivalent of about two of the cans of broth.  I then removed two cups of the potatoes, mashed them, then returned them to the pot and stirred in.  The consistancy was perfect after that.  To adjust the flavor to my liking, I added two tablespoons of minced garlic and a teaspoon of thyme.  My husband and I thought it was perfect after that.

I prepared this for our Valentine's Day dinner and while we liked it, it did not have the flavour I was expecting and it did not thicken up as much as I expected either.  I thought that maybe after sitting overnight the flavours would meld, but I still felt it needed something. So, I added some more seafood to it with  a flaked fillet of cooked haddock and I prepared a roux to thicken it up more as well. With these changes, it was excellent. That said,  I have only had shrimp bisque once and that was at least 20 yrs ago, so I am by no means a connoisseur and my recollection may be fuzzy.  As I said, we did enjoy it, and I would probably make it again adding more seafood and the roux. Thx for sharing your recipe. Made for Soup Fest 2011.",2011-02-15T14:30:03Z,2011-02-15T14:30:03Z

I made a Christmas brunch one year and invited the neighbors.  I had tons of different things to choose.  Everyone was chowing down and rating their favories.  Well my DH comes in for his plate, picks up the crab and states ""Now that's GOOD.""  We just died.  He was never so red faced as when he found out what it was called.

First, I used a 6 oz. can of pineapple orange juice in place of the water, making up the difference with 2 oz water.  I also used orange extract instead of lemon.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, took it out when done and then wrapped it in plastic wrap to let it rest for 10 min.   I then braided it and let it rise again for 30 min.

1192361,129926,666128,Dardus,5,I've been making this recipe for a while. I'm surprised I haven't put up a review yet. I love this recipe. I make the sauce a little thicker by not adding all the chicken broth at once and then adjust the thickness after I put the sour cream in. I do this because DH likes the sauce thicker. I also sometimes use taco bell taco seasoning on the chicken (like you would for taco meat). By far it's one of my favorite chicken recipes due to yumminess and also because of it's versatility. You can add a lot of different vegetables to it in addition using different cheeses.<br/>I also tend to use lower sodium chicken broth and low fat sour cream.,2011-02-15T19:33:23Z,2011-02-15T19:33:23Z

My cake didn't pull away from the sides at all so I didn't realize it was done till it was too late; the cake ended up with a very thin blackish layer and very little sauce left. Still..... the rest of the cake? DIVINE. Still wonderfully moist and chocolatey - not too much chocolate, perfect amount of sweetness for me. It was rich but not too much so - actually a little lighter than I was expecting, maybe because there was very little of the gooey sauce left, but it was great. Just gotta keep a closer eye on the cake as it cooks next time (and there will definitely be a next time!)

1192439,154197,817413,muyfeliz,4,"I made this cake for a German themed potluck.  It was very well received.  Not only was the cake gorgeous, it was also very tasty.  One of my friends said it was like ""German Tiramisu"".  I made the cake one night, cut, filled and put together the layers the next night and then frosted with whipped cream and decorated the next morning.  It held up well in the fridge for until it was served that night.  I was afraid the whipped cream would not hold up which is why I did that part as close to serving as possible.  I made the cake nearly exactly as written.  The only changes I made were that I soaked the cherries in a kirsch/water mixture overnight and I added some chocolate pieces (ground up chocolate chips) to the butter cream filling.  The recipe for the butter cream did not have enough wet ingredients.  I tried to make it as written and it would not come together.  I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more butter.  Next time I make this I will add even more butter (probably a total of a cup) as it was still quite stiff.  I had to warm up my frosting spatula periodically while applying the butter cream because it was so stiff that it didn't want to spread.  Warming up my spatula in hot water helped considerably.  I applied chocolate shavings to the sides and decorated the top with whipped cream rosettes, cherries and chocolate shavings.  I think next time I make it I will be more liberal with the kirsch than I was this time.  I thought the cake would taste too much like alcohol but it actually could have benefitted from more of the liqueur.  Overall this cake was a crowd pleaser and I will be making it again.",2011-02-16T01:51:28Z,2011-02-16T01:51:28Z

The only thing that I might complain about is that the recipe didn't suggest covering the casserole and after 35 minutes on the middle rack in my oven, the Swiss cheese on top was pretty burned and crunchy (which personally, I thought it made it taste even better!).

I had to make some changes because I didn't have exactly the ingredients called for, but I think they match the flavour. So I used a hazelnut flavoured decaf - the hazelnut flavour is not strong at all, so I think that's perfect. Also I don't get Swiss Miss cocoa here, so I used Monbana 100% Hot Chocolate (no sweetener added). For the caramel topping I used my home made caramel sauce made from whole cane sugar. This really wasn't quite sweet, which is perfect for me. Coffee and Chocolate with that dark caramel flavour and a hint of hazelnut - absolutely delicious!

I did use half a non-organic lemon but I want to make this again and I know it would taste better and be 100% better for me with an organic one. I tasted it without honey added and loved it but I added a little for it's heath benefit mainly and it was nice too.

But the extra benefit of having this recipe is that it produces individual servings for those times in the off-season when you want just a glass or two and you can't find any in the grocery store.  And most of the other Eggnog recipes yield such massive quantities that might be OK for the holidays when lots of people will want it.  But for other times of the year, it's great to have a recipe like this, and you won't have tons left over that that will have to be thrown away.  Thanks, Pink Diamond.

I may have taken the term 'smashed' too literally :), next time I'd chop it up more.  The chickpea lover in the house thought they were fantastic, and I really liked the broccoli best.  The broth was of course fantastic!  I could have used more broth just to drizzle on top.

This salad is great contrast in flavors, sweet, tangy, spicy, yum! The bite of the wasabi and onion against the pecans and cranberries and slightly sweet dressing was great and I loved the textures.   Changes - decreased to two servings ( except the garlic, I used 1 whole clove) - big mistake I wanted more dressing to have it again tonight. I used regular cream cheese, no frozen peas - I hate peas and if  I'd left them in I'd be grossed out and give one star - didn't want to do that. I had carmelized pecans on hand so I didn't carmelize the wasabi peas for the topping - I don't think it mattered. The dressing was very thick so I added a bit more oil and then some half and half until it was at a point where I could toss it with the greens . I used the red onion, but the one I had was so hot, even though I cut it in slivers, I ended up picking them out - I was actually getting onion tears while eating the salad. After removal there was still onion flavor, I'll use scallions next time.

The ingredient listed is for both ""one chilies"" and a 7oz can.  Since we have never made a recipe that used more than 3 peppers at once, I erred on the side of caution and used only two.  I usually keep the remainder of a can in a small glass jar in the fridge, so I didn't have a full 7 ozs anyway, but the two peppers made it plenty hot that DH said it was almost too hot for him.  It burned the back of the throat, but with the crazy winter weather we've been having, it definitely had a soothing quality to it.  We'll be making this one again & again!

I also had a lot of trouble with the gnocchi crumbling in the water. I did like the way they tasted (though they were a bit bland when made as stated) but I think next time I would definitely prefer to eat them in a lasagna or stuffed shell instead of by themselves because I think they lacked enough flavor and texture to really make them sufficient as a stand alone dish.,2011-02-17T01:52:35Z,2011-02-17T01:52:35Z

I guess the green color is deceptive or something. lol I used La Sabrozita salsa verde (a Mexican brand) and it was very good for a bottled salsa.

I too, also used coconut milk per everyone's suggestion. Great substitute to evaporated milk; made the soup creamy and rich. NOT that the soup is bland by any means, but I will be adding a little spice to it next time to give it a little kick. I didn't find the soup spicy at all, again not a critique, just an observation compared to some comments... I love this recipe because it's very obvious even after my first attempt, that you can add your own touch to it without throwing the intended flavor off. For instance if you prefer more of a curry taste or pumpkin influence, then add a bit more of either. As is however, it is very balanced between the two flavors.

I have experimented with adding different extras to make them even more special. Here is my current opinion<br/>1) cinnamon = excellent choice. Almost essential<br/>2) apples = so good. I have a dehydrator so I try to get some of the excess liquid out of them first. <br/>3) shredded carrots = a nice way to add a few extra nutrients<br/>Other things that I've added but been less impressed with include walnuts (my family liked them but I didn't think they were worth the extra calories), dried blueberries (too much added sugar, fresh would probably be better), freeze dried mango (good in that they're easy and I had some to use up but not the best). With the added stuff, I was able to make rather good sized muffins. Depending on which extra, they come out to about 100-115 calories each.<br/>Also I've noticed that others have commented on the fact that the muffin papers really stick to these suckers.

The only thing I had trouble with is I couldn't get it to thicken up like I thought it should but then again maybe I miss measured. Anyway I loved it and served it with Fish Piccata--Easy and Economical#448267 and spinach with garlic and shallots.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.,2011-02-17T13:15:42Z,2011-02-17T13:15:42Z

I added some celery & frozen corn, frozen black beans, some chicken broth, yellow & orange peppers as that was what I had, and then realized I was out of diced tomatoes so used a bit of V8 juice.

I thought that I might have to bake them for a shorter time because they were so thin, but I actually had to bake them about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said.  I used a Pyrex pan, though, so that could be why.  Some people put them on crackers, which worked out well.  They were good by themselves, though, too.  I greased the pan just to be sure they wouldn't stick and they came out just fine.  I will definitely be making this again!",2011-02-17T14:01:34Z,2011-02-17T14:01:34Z

Love the combo of ingredients and curry/chutney flavor, which I don't think I've had before in a salad.

It is amazing that so little seasoning is required, and I loved the fact that there was no need for the ususal suspects: garlic, onion, and ginger. This is all about the vegetables, and the few seasonings (soy sauce & sesame oil) come across stronger. Those on a diet can think of this as a night off restrictions, since there is so little real fat--there is oil, which is fat, but per serving, that comes up low. Put whatever you have in your frig--I added broccoli and cauliflower. Tiger lillies do add something, if you have them. A great cleanser.",2011-02-17T19:03:13Z,2011-02-17T19:03:13Z

I think next time I may saute the onions before adding into the chicken mixture or either add less, so it isn't such a strong flavor.  The onions don't soften all the way during the cook time. The way I see it with any recipe, make it as directed in the recipe the first time, then you can always tweak it to fit your own personal taste later after you are familiar with it!

I used canola oil instead of grape seed oil, yellow raisins to give more of a contrast in colour and flavour wise in this I think they would go better than Thompson raisins. I used a modified version of Recipe#253004, roasted pistachios which I shelled and chopped up a little in my small blender, Balkan (thick) yogurt stirred, I really recommend the yogurt with this, plus the rest.

The (entire) recipe is great; I've only had one person, out of the many people I've served it to, not like it.  The Veggie Roll Ups, or wraps, are so versatile for a group of people.  The Veggie Roll Ups are great for those that are vegans or vegetarians and by adding some sliced roasted turkey or chicken to the Roll Ups, omnivores (like my husband and I) love them too.

No green pepper but I added chopped celery like another reviewer suggested and I used a small can of diced green chilis in place of the jalapeño. My husband (a recent reluctant convert to vegetarianism) went on about a veg. chili we'd had at a party recently that he really liked so I thought I'd try this one. He liked this one even better but we both felt it was a little sweet. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half, tone the chili powder down a little (it was a little warm for me), add a little more cumin, and serve with cornbread!

1193024,126279,1829085,Joshua Keaton,5,"This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I actually made this cake twice over the weekend, the first was for a company party where everyone could bring their own dish, and it was such a huge hit with everybody that I made it again for my family reunion on Sunday. At both events, people couldn't stop talking about how great the cake was! It really was delicious, and I'm saving this recipe in a special place for the next time I make a cake.<br/><br/>I will note that I followed the recipe, and the ingredients, to the letter. It couldn't have turned out better either time.<br/><br/>Regarding using less ricotta cheese, this is absolutely not necessary. If you have any sort of experience with ricotta cheese, then you know that different brands have differing levels of wetness. For a recipe like this, where you need the mixture to be firm, you need to use a drier ricotta cheese.<br/><br/>Also, you shouldn't have extra filling, it is all meant to be used. The entirety of the filling mixture is supposed to be put on the bottom cake layer, with most of it being in the center, creating a thick dome-shaped layer of filling. If there is more left in the bowl, then you haven't put enough on. If your filling is not thick enough to hold its shape at all, then either you haven't made it properly or the ricotta you've used is too wet.<br/><br/>For the part where it says to cut a wedge out of the top cake layer, the wedge should be about 1/6 of the total size. This stops the cake from breaking when you lay it on the dome-shaped filling. You then reinsert the wedge after setting it down.<br/><br/>Thanks to the person who mentioned what cookbook this is from, I'm definitely going to be purchasing it in the near future.",2011-02-17T23:35:34Z,2011-02-17T23:35:34Z

I used homemade chicken stock and must not have salted it because I did have to add some.  We both loved it and I will be making this many times.  The Wonton soup in the can is gross IMO and I like knowing that quality ingredients are nestled in the wontons and not some 'mystery mush'.

But I did add a few changes.<br/><br/>I used mascarpone  which I prefer over cream cheese, and added a few fine chopped dried cranberries. It gave it a bit of sweetness and was very enjoyable texture wise. The apricots I grilled. I brushed them with honey and lightly grilled them. So they were lightly warm, but nothing too much. Pistachios were a great touch.<br/><br/>Again, this was my take.

1193142,242482,463435,Chef Buggsy Mate,5,We don't eat red meat that often and when we do it usually isn't steak however; this recipe might just change that. I used beef tenderloin medallions for the steak and shitaki mushrooms to top them off with. A wonderful steak house style steak that everyone in the family loved.

1193148,257892,339260,Crafty Lady 13,5,"I halved this recipe and it fit perfectly in my little 6 1/2 x 6 1/2 corning ware casserole dish, but after tasting it I wished I had made the full amount.  I made exactly as written, except that I added a slice of Velveeta cheese over the sauce on each of the layers.  I have never made mac and cheese where you sprinkle the cheese over the macaroni and then pour a white sauce over it.  I had always added the cheese to the sauce and then poured that over the macaroni.  I must say this made for a creamy and delicious macaroni and cheese.  I made half the recipe and ended up with about 2 1/2 servings.  The leftovers reheat very nicely and doesn't lose any of its creaminess.  My MIL loves mac and cheese, but has never made homemade mac and cheese.  I will have to make this over at their house and give them a special treat.

I should have cooked it a couple minutes less on each side because I ended up with more of a medium steak, but I am sure it is due to the oven I used.  The steak turned out very juicy and tasty.

I used canola oil in a cast iron pan as we don't use peanut oil because of an allergy and I didn't think the dish I was serving it with would work with sesame flavour. I did use the garlic which was a nice addition, used cooked white Basmati rice with a bit of butter & sea salt. I served it with recipe#118137 and it went quite well. I may make this again.

Ease of preparation, great flavor (depends on your barbecue sauce, so use a good one that you like) and enjoyed by the whole family.  I made my own hamburger buns from my recipe#445540 and it went very well.  I used a bottled sauce that I tweaked to our liking, cooked the onions with the chicken in the crock pot, and served with jalapeno slices and cheese.  Don't do what I did, thinking it didn't have enough water I added a 1/4 cup to the pot when I started and it watered it down WAY to much as it cooked, had to drain it off and add more sauce.  The recipe is right on as to how to fix this very comforting, fast dish.  Made for Comfort Foods in the photo forum.",2011-02-19T10:32:29Z,2011-02-19T10:32:29Z

1193269,421872,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns ,3,"I made this for my husband who loves chicken and dumplings. I had never had them before. He was disappointed, because the broth was so thin and watery. He said all the ones he's eaten had a thickened broth like a thin gravy. The flavor of the broth was good though. He also felt the bottom of the dumplings were too pasty. I think this might be due to it being in a crockpot. Even though mine was on high, the broth wasn't boiling/simmering when I added the dumplings. I imagine preparing this dish on a stove top that would better enable you to control the heat would help with that problem.",2011-02-19T15:32:50Z,2011-02-19T15:32:50Z

I followed the recipe exactly and put in 1/2 cup choc chips and 1/2 cup reese's pb chips. The batter was really thick and pasty (I don't think it could have held more than 1 cup of chip add-ins or there would have been more add-ins than batter). It took me a few minutes to get it to evenly spread the thick batter into the pan evenly so that I couldn't see the bottom of the pan as it was so thick there were some random holes in the middle and other parts of the pan. For the record I did use a metal square 8x8 pan (a good one not a cheap one) - after reading the review saying the metal one turned out dryer I reduced the cooking time from 25 minutes to 18 minutes. The result was something very strange. They were slightly bendy (I wouldn't call them chewy because they crumbled as they cooled) but tasted more like a cake...a very dry cake. This recipe didn't yield that crumbly chocolate glaze on top that the typical brownie gets while cooking either. Maybe the glass pan gives a different result, but I won't be trying that as I'm rather disappointed in the way this turned out in taste, texture, and overall dislike.

Also used knox gelatin to thicken.  YUM! <br/><br/>For the chicken dough, I used almond flour in place of the wheat flour, coconut flour in place of the starch, and added a tablespoon of ground flax meal to make it a tad bit healthier. Also used gluten-free baking powder. <br/><br/>Fried in vegetable oil (soybean) using an asparagus steamer that we got for our wedding. Worked amazingly!! <br/><br/>After going about 4 years without tasting the deliciousness that is American Chinese food, I can now say that I was almost in tears from this wonderful recipe.

Add chocolate chips to the dry ingredients and mix well, this will help prevent the chips from sinking to the bottom, then add in the wet ingredients and mix well.  Pour half the batter into the other mug and then microwave. It is perfect every time as long as you cook it in 1 minute intervals to check for doneness.

And seeing how Relleno's are one of our most favorite Mexican foods, well you can see the conflict. I  was slightly off my game yesterday, so when I made this I totally spaced that I had 5 big poblano chilies. After following the recipe, there wasn't enough ""batter"" to cover my chilies. I made another 1/2 recipe, probably not really enough either. But in the oven they went. They stuck to my pan like a son of a gun. However, the flavor and texture was there! After thinking about this recipe I realized it is very similar to a breakfast item called a Dutch Baby. A crepe batter that is poured into a very hot pan with melted butter and baked until puffy and brown. A much wetter batter. So for me this recipe is a keeper. I love that you can have leftovers as my husband takes a lunch every day. I will be making quite often as I can now have a non-fried Relleno, hooorayyy!!!",2011-02-20T11:12:21Z,2011-02-20T11:12:21Z

After leaving overnight - probably about 20 hours - it hadn't risen and was very runny - almost like a Yorkshire pudding batter, we thought all was lost.  Then we tried to do the tea towel thing, but it was too runny, so just to see what may happen, we decided to pour it into our Le Creusit (after greasing w/ olive oil) and going for it.  OK, it was a bit dense, but the crust is to die for and it is a good bread.  Then we realised that instant yeast wasn't the same as regular dried, after reading the other reviews, so next time will go on their tips and add more dried yeast and a bit less water and I think it will be a total winner.  But I'm already giving 5 stars (which is something I rarely do) as the transition from what looked to be a total disaster to a good loaf of bread was incredible.  It completely doesn't make any logical sense, even for a non-baker like me, but it works, Go For It!",2011-02-20T11:31:37Z,2011-02-20T11:31:37Z

I made the dough and instead of letting it rise and then shape the dough, I did it the other way around making the shapes and then let it rise.  I think it made for prettier sticks.  I also whipped an egg and brushed the sticks with the egg before salting and putting them in the oven.  I thought they would rise more than then did (certainly didn't double as I was expecting - more like 25%)  Good texture but would make them larger next time.

Even though I made one big mistake by undercooking the potato, it was still very good (I didn't get the really smooth mash that is required here - a ricer would be a perfect tool to use).  And my gnocci shape was so-so, but I went on youtube and watched a few people do it - eventually holding a fork in one hand and running a piece of gnocci over it with the other...took me ages at first but once I got it the process was pretty quick. The sauce was really good, I had some roasted garlic on hand so I used that up.  The only thing I'm wondering is whether or not that should have read 2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp of both basil and oregano.  I didn't mind it at all, but next time I think I'd add to either the sauce or the gnocci, maybe not both.  This also makes a lot, 4 good sized portions could stretch further for a lunch menu.

I beat the egg whites for about a minute before adding in the syrup, based on other reviews, then I think I ended up mixing for closer to ten mins of more with my hand mixer. I also used about a teaspoon each of vanilla and almond, plus a couple drops of red food coloring to make pink frosting. The frosting was delicious, but unfortunately, the cupcakes (cherry chip) completely overpowered the taste of the frosting. Fiance said that it was good, but not what he was expecting.

If I used pre-made crusts again I would add another 1/2 c of cream.  I made mine in a deep dish pie plate and added about 10 oz. of peas and carrots (guesstimated from a 16 oz. bag), and also added a well drained can of mushrooms.  We felt the 2 cups of chicken was skimpy for a deep dish pie, 3 cups would have been better. I used leftover grilled rosemary-garlic chicken thighs. For the chicken broth I used 1 Herb-Ox packet dissolved in 1/2 cup of white wine.  I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 40 minutes.

The only things I would add are that you can use butter, margarine or almost any oil; and the best way to check that they are done is to squeeze them. You can do this with your hand if you are fairly quick about it, even though they are very hot. The skin should feel well cooked and the flesh should give quite easily.

The sauce was a beautiful consistency, and so flavoursome, and was delish spooned over the brown rice ( a great choice to pair it with). Next time I would add a little more chilli, but we like things on the spicier side.<br/>Leftovers heated up well too, and were just as enjoyable.<br/>Made for AUS/NZ Recipe Swap#49.<br/>Thanks Paula",2011-02-19T00:24:24Z,2011-02-19T00:24:24Z
1193682,147659,710155,jaybee chef,0,"I made a few variations, and it came out good.  I seasoned the meat prior to browning with my homemade cumin spice blend (cumin, chili powder, cayenne, granulated onion and garlic, salt and pepper), so I reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp and I used garlic salt in place of the salt and used no more than 1 tsp.  I added a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies, and for the garlic I used the minced refrigerator variety (lazy me!).  Instead of fresh cilantro I used about 3 T of my homemade cilantro pesto.  After cooking 11/2 hrs the meat was not yet tender.  I ended cooking it another 2 hours on simmer to reduce some of the sauce, since there was more than I desired.  By then the meat was definitely tender.  Next time I think I'll cook more pork for the same volumes of liquid and it will be just right.  I do think 2 hours may be a better simmering time (my pork was in about 11/2 inch cubes).  This was very easy except for the time spent trimming the meat of all the fat.  I actually think the flavors were a little too sharp and competitive, so with the leftovers I made enchiladas.  I used the meat mixed with equal amounts of grated sharp cheddar and mexican cheese blend (mild soft white cheeses) and sour cream and topped with a mix of half mild salsa and half the sauce from the leftovers.  I felt this really mellowed it out and I preferred it to the chile verde served with rice, beans, tortillas and condiments of guacamole, sour cream, cheese, etc.",2011-02-19T01:08:38Z,2011-02-19T01:08:38Z
1193683,12458,1832146,heyscarlet,5,"Great flavor with this recipe. And while I'm sure it is great in a crockpot, I wanted a more flavorful moist chicken so I cooked it in a dutch oven. I rubbed the chicken (I used split chicken breasts) with the Italian seasoning and then browned it in a dutch oven. I did not cook the chicken through, but just enough to get great color on it. I then removed the chicken and sauteed the garlic and onion, then adding the rest of the ingredients. I saw that many people recommended adding mushrooms to the sauce, great idea. But to do this I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken. I really recommend the Whole Foods brand, it is amazing. After getting the sauce to a simmer I added the chicken back and cooked covered for an additional 40 minutes. The chicken was perfectly tender and the browning gave it another level of flavor.",2011-02-19T01:55:27Z,2011-02-19T01:55:27Z

After tasting, I added a few extras--a little garlic powder, about a tablespoon of paprika, and a couple shakes of grated parmesan cheese. I also used sharp cheddar cheese and mozzarella. The flavor turned out reminiscent of a Stroganoff which I loved, but I found that after about 3 hours my pasta had turned to mush. I even used cavatappi pasta, which is larger than the elbows. It gave the end result a ""pasty"" texture, which spoiled an otherwise 5 star dish. The recipe does state ""6 hours or until pasta is tender"", but I guess I thought I had a bigger window of time to play with than I actually did. Next time I will either cook it for only two hours max, or cook the meat mixture only for five hours or so and then add the pasta in the last two hours.

I made this with low sodium soy sauce, and doubled the entire recipe. I also added udon noodles after it was done frying. When I was making the marinade it seemed like an excessive amount of soy sauce, so I put in a few less tablespoons than it asked for. It still came out extremely salty! So if you make this, use far less soy sauce and perhaps add water to make up for the volume of the rest of the marinade. It was about the right amount of liquid, with a pound of noodles.

Dipping in egg then in cornstarch not mixing together.  The Orange sauce was far to little, so we tripled it immediately, since we had doubled the recipe, and it was still far to little.  Almost needed to up it ten times even for the recipe without the doubling.  We only used the zest of one orange as required by the recipe and that to was far to much zest.

At first tasting the lemon glaze I thought yikes its so tart it may be too much but it was perfect.  I used all natural chicken breasts & they cut with a spoon they were so tender.  The mustard adds taste texture & holds the bread crumbs (used Italian more added flavor). Also used capers which adds depth to the dish.

The ingredients that I used were canola oil instead of applesauce because I had no applesauce and used 1 regular egg instead of a egg substitute and I added 1 cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips and these were wonderful. Nice and moist,had to watch the timer as I made jumbo muffins (about 8) and they took about 22 minutes to bake,keeping a eye on them. I use a cake tester to check them to make sure they are done completely. Do not over mix the batter just enough to get all ingredients mixed up. Definitely will be making these again.

As stated in the note, the chocolate is essential to this sauce!  I used homemade chicken stock, ancho chili powder, and extra dark hershey's chocolate (it was on hand).  The ancho is a mild chili, so my sauce was not terribly spicy, which is fine, since I plan to freeze most of it for later use.  If I want spicy, I can add more when I use it.

A couple changes I will try next time will be to change out the mushrooms for green chilis or mexicorn or roasted red peppers or ??? I love mushrooms but they didn't go with the salsa.

I added the onion, orange bell pepper, and sliced pepperoncini peppers along with the salad dressing mix. I also added about 1/4 cup of the pepperocini juice to the bottom of the crock pot before adding all the other ingredients. Because I have a new crock pot that cooks much hotter then my old one, I cooked my roast on low for 10 hrs. and it turned out perfect. For the bread, I chose crusty rolls from the bakery department at our market. I added a slice each of provolone and mozzarella cheese to one side of the rolls and broiled them until they were toasted and the cheese was melted. The extra juice was placed in ramekins so that those who wanted could dip their sandwiches. This is a definite keeper... and a recipe I will go to often. Thanks so much for posting.

The first few breasts I cooked in it seemed like they were missing something, so I added a little honey, which helped. Next time I think I will add some seasoning to the flour mixture and see how that tastes -- and I might also marinate it in some of the sauce if I have the time.I cut the chicken in half to make each breast skinnier, so I wouldn't have to pound it and it would cook quicker. I doubled the sauce like a reviewer recommended and glad I did. I think if you felt inclined, you could add a little corn starch to thicken it. We served it up on rice and sauteed zucchini, which soaked up the sauce nicely. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!",2011-02-21T20:31:44Z,2011-02-21T20:31:44Z

The pecans were scattered on top and finally sprinkled with a small amount of freshly grated nutmeg. ~Tasty Dish~ unfortunately is on a toddler hunger strike (she's not liking anything these days) and poor mommy had to eat her portion! My serving had a splash of milk around the edges and I felt I were cheating by eating pecan pie for breakfast! ;) Old fashioned oats worked out fine. I was a little worried because old fashioned is all I had on hand. (We eat a good amount of oatmeal in our household.)

1194137,69173,779699,SarahBeth,5,These were delicious! My first attempt at making meatballs and it turned out great! I used 1 pound of 81/19 ground beef and 1 pound of mild italian sausage. I added a bit more bread crumb and milk since I added to the meat amount overall by 1/2 pound and just did by feel of the mixture. I still only used one egg. I used some Italian bread crumbs that I make and keep on hand and just added a littl extra oregano and dried parsely. I baked for 15 minutes and simmered in the sauce for 20 minutes. They turned out AMAZING and DH has said this is his new favorite way to eat spaghetti. So much for the regular plain ground Italian sausage I normally brown for my sauce!

I let the butter cool and slowly add it to the eggs while whisking the whole time to not cook the eggs.  Then I add the milk, this makes a more smooth batter.  I let the batter rest for at least 1 hour, preferably wait overnight, and then use it.  Much easier to handle when it has time to rest.

So I threw in half a bag of frozen mixed veggies into the soup/cream mixture. I think without the veggies, the dish could have easily been way too rich and less healthy.

I had doubled the sauce, and added just a bit more Thai chili sauce. If i had a few green onions i wouldve chopped them, and garnished the chops with that.

The can of coconut milk I had was totally separated with hard white bits and a clear jellyish liquid! I know, I know I should only buy organic, it was not :/ I happened to have homogenized milk on hand even though we don't purchase or consume it, I used it since I had already committed to make this for DD right away. DD didn't mind but I don't feel milk is good for her (we have allergies to dairy, especially milk), I used frozen bananas which works well, halal vanilla paste in a bit less amount, I trusted DD to taste it and tell me when I had added enough white sugar! Another thing we avoid but what could I do, I don't use agave as I don't think it is healthy at all either. I think I used a bit more sugar than the called for amount of agave. I did add carob chips, she liked it with and without. A toddler, she was already eating the ice cream before it was done...

I typically use buttermilk as the liquid for extra softness.  I do not find a heavy baking powder taste as other reviewers have noted.  As for the fat; I have used both olive and canola oils.  I have also reduced the oil by half and substituted applesauce for the remainder.  I find that 2c whole wheat and 1c AP flour is a great option for those wanting a less dense bread.  Sorry, I do not consider this a biscuit in any form.  It slices, toasts, and performs like any other yeast free bread.  I definitely recommend this one.",2011-02-22T20:42:04Z,2011-02-22T20:42:04Z

I used one can of Westbrae organic garbanzo beans and instead of water to thin the hummus the bean liquid was used.

Directions said nothing about what to do with the reserve sauce and I was not going to throw it away.

I was out of fennel, so used rosemary in it's place.  I rubbed the spices into the roast and sprinkled the remaining over the potatoes, onions and apples.  The roast was browned it in a tsp of olive oil on the stove, and the pan then deglazed with 3/4 cup chicken stock and 1/4 cup white wine (semi dry).

My kids tried it on it's own and said no thanks though.

This could be due to the fact that I used peach juice but the recipe didn't specify which juice was best. Perhaps using apple juice might have given a more translucent result. I also used a bit of honey which might have added too much colour as I can't get corn syrup here. Perhaps glucose might have worked better.

1194527,62997,447487,Just_Ducky,3,"I used homemade turkey stock for this soup that I already had, added chopped garlic because I add garlic to most dishes and some whey (from my yoghurt making) for protein. After the veggies were sufficiently soft I pureed using my hand blender. To get my boys to eat it they ended up adding lots of saltines and quite a bit of raita and homemade yoghurt, their vote was ""meh"" and don't really want me to make it again. Having said that I will likely make it, with alterations, for myself for lunches. Without the raita it was rather bland, so that will definitely be a must to add to the bowl before eating. I was probably more a 3 1/2 with the soup, but the the ingredient amounts were unclear, fluid ounces are not really appropriate for solid food and weight requires a scale, a kitchen gadget not everyone owns so I rounded down rather than up. Like kiwidutch says, personal preference is the key though, the ingredients appealed to me and I'm glad I tried it. With a few changes it'll be a keeper for me, if not my boys. My rating system (newly developed) is on my profile if that helps at all. Thanks for posting. Made for TOTM's Soup-Fest 2011 tag game. :-)",2011-02-23T19:50:26Z,2011-02-23T19:50:26Z

I put the noodles in too early I think though because it soaked up more of the liquid than I wanted, next time will definitely have to do it only an hour ahead at most or precook them as some other did and throw in after. I had plenty of leftovers so froze them and used them a week later by turning them into lasagna basically since it was too thick to be soup anymore and took to a pot luck meal. Rave reviews from everyone. Very tasty and an easy meal, either as a soup, or let it go thick into an easy lasagna, either way it was yum :), thanks for posting.

I just want to eat them.

I added an onion, 3 garlic cloves, fresh mushrooms, 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/2 tsp. dried oregano, and 1/2 tsp dried basil to the sausage while browning.  I dumped 1 & 1/2 jars of our favorite sauce before I read to keep them separate, and added 1/2 cup red wine to the red meat sauce mixture.  I used fat free ricotta and added a thawed/drained box of chopped spinach, salt, and pepper to the ricotta mixture.  My last change was to add whole wheat noodle to the whole thing.  I held back some of the red meat sauce I made and put this on top.   DH went back for seconds, and has packed some to take to work tomorrow.  Next time I make this, I am going to double it up and freeze some in disposable containers to pull from the freezer on those busy long days when I don't feel like cooking.  Thanks for sharing.

We all loved this recipe the addition of the onion and bacon is totally gorgeous and really adds that extra flavour to take this dish over the top. I did up the milk to 2 1/2 cups the cheese to 2 1/2 cups and used three tablespoons of flour as I was making 2 smaller cauliflowers. I also did a mix of tasty and Parmesan cheese. I was not sure where the extra bacon was supposed to go as you had it listed as add half the bacon to the onion mix and then nothing in the steps as to where the rest went. I thought maybe it was supposed to go on top with the breadcrumbs and cheese but as I was not sure if it would cook properly in the oven, I chose to add it all in with the onion mix, which worked out great.

1194629,42038,262272,cookee monster,5,I was looking for a pancake recipe and stumpled onto this recipe.  My DS was earning a cooking badge for Cub Scouts and the recipe was so simple we gave it a try.  I love blueberries and have some in the freezer at all times.  My berries were a little frosty so I let them thaw at a low temp in the pan.  There was quite a bit of liquid so I didn't add the water.  This was so good I may never use syrup again!,2011-02-24T12:19:57Z,2011-02-24T12:19:57Z

I always add a cup of raisins and a half cup of chopped walnuts to the mix. I also substitute 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil. The last time I made oat bran muffins (just last Saturday), I used the recipe on the back of the Kroger brand oat bran with called for 1/2 cup more oat bran and no honey or molasses. The muffins were less sweet, but with the addition of the applesauce and raisins, I've found I like them better this way.",2011-02-24T12:27:36Z,2011-02-24T12:27:36Z
1194631,268890,1329782,SarasotaCook,5,"I definitely enjoyed this. Very simple flavors and not hard to make at all.<br/>I used skin on bone in breasts but mine only took just a bit over 1 hour. However, I know that times are not written in stone. And all chicken breasts are NOT the same size. The cook just needs to check and I know that. So I took the chicken out, cooled a bit and shred.<br/><br/>2 notes. I used scallions chopped fine vs a white onion for the garnish, but mostly the white bits. I just liked the flavor more.  But I did try it both ways. However, that is personal preference. I did like the crunchy flavor on top as a texture difference.<br/><br/>The other note. The amounts of the water. Now I was fine figuring it out myself. But a beginner cook may not realize that.  I used a wide oval pot so that can vary the amount vs a stock pot type of utensil. The same with the water used with the peppers and garlic. It just needs to have an amount I think.  <br/>Also, you may want to give a rough estimate of the amount of chilies. I used about 9 and it wasn't too spicy for me.<br/><br/>But back to the flavor. Excellent, tasty, very good and comforting. Cilantro and lemon really compliment the dish.<br/>I will make again. Very simple, fresh flavors and just a good soup. A definite soup worth making.<br/>Made for Soup Fest 2011 Tag game",2011-02-24T12:42:09Z,2011-02-24T12:42:09Z

It turns out this really didn't matter much because the cookie sort of slid down during the baking process. Then I was concerned that there wasn't enough of a side crust to hold in the filling but there really wasn't much of a filling so it didn't matter. Then I thought there wasn't enough sugar in the cheesecake part but I realized that it can't be too sweet because the nutella is plenty sweet. My filling was a littel lumpy but it didn't really matter in the end. They tasted GREAT!<br/>The only note I have it that mine don't look like the picture at all. In mine, the filling is the same thickness or maybe a little thinner than the cookie layer. But I loved the cookie layer so I don't care. Great easy recipe with unlimited possibilities for variation. <br/>Thanks for posting.",2011-02-24T13:12:26Z,2011-02-24T13:12:26Z

I had to make a couple of changes- used freshly grated romano instead of parmesan and had to make some more bread crumbs using saltines and Ritz crackers since I was low on regular bread crumbs and I used 2% cheddar and olive oil (instead of butter) to coat the chicken in.  The chicken turned out moist and VERY flavorful.  I will save this recipe and make it again AND again.  My picky 5 year old cleaned his plate!! He doesn't typically like meat so this is a huge praise!!  I think next time I will add more garlic.  It smelled soooo good when it was baking.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added the parmesan at the beginning of the cooking process and also added some Italian Seasoning.

I cooked it in a frypan (skillet) so it cooked a bit in the marinade as I spooned it on rather than brushing but took up the flavours beautifully, took about 20 to 25 minutes to cook through on a low to medium heat after initially browning on a higher heat but the end result was a moist a very flavoursome piece of chicken.

This was flavorful without taking away from the actual piece of meat.  I used 4-5 lb. tenderloins since it was for a large group, so the cooking time was longer for me but if I was doing this at home, with a smaller tenderloin I would probably increase the oven temp to 375.  The crumbs on the outside of the tenderloin would have browned a little more, giving them a little more flavor and color.  I also think you could start it at 425 for 15 min. and turn the oven down to 350 when you cover it, if you are using a larger tenderloin.  The presentation was excellent and I received rave reviews.

It has turned out delicious EVERY time. In place of the chicken breasts, I often use canned chicken, with perhaps not equal, but satisfying results. Rather than boiling the first six ingredients as the recipe states (if using regular chicken breasts), I simply saute the celery, onion and carrot and mix it with the soup, 2 cups of water and some chicken soup base/bouillon in place of actual chicken broth. In place of the self-rising flour, I use 1 c flour, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder. I do follow the same basic assembly instructions as the recipe states, but first putting the melted butter in the pan, then the chicken, then the flour and milk mixture, and lastly the soup/vegetable mixture.

I used cheddar and havarti cheese slices for this.  I allowed it to chill for 5 hours before baking.  I didn't use the mushroom soup to serve; it really wasn't necassary, in my opinion.  This casserole was cheesy and yummy.  Great for a brunch with fruit on the side.  Thanx!",2011-02-24T20:17:22Z,2011-02-24T20:17:22Z

1194882,223483,615758,Grandma Lynn,5,This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I don't have a bread machine so I used my Kitchenaid mixer.  I put everything in the bowl except the flour and let the yeast become active (when it bubbles) before adding the bread flour.  I mixed it on low for 6 min. and then rolled it out as directed.  Simple and comes out great every time.  I have made it 3 times now and even sprinkled garlic powder inside with some melted butter. YUMMMM.

1194885,223590,593513,FrenchBunny,5,Wow !!! This was absolutely delicious for lunch. I had cut the recipe in half because there were only two of us. As well I still have never found a pepperoni that I like here in the States. So I used Hebrew National Salami....oh what a flavor. I had made Recipe #51861 for the dipping sauce and they both worked perfectly together. Quite a filling lunch. This recipe was just so quick to put together to get ready for the oven. I had prepared everything in the morning and brought it to work to just pop in the oven.

1194886,448053,50509,duonyte,4,"This turned out quite well, perhaps not as creamy as a traditional risotto, but close. I used one medium large onion, and that contributed a strong onion flavor, so you might want to consider how much onion to use. I used mushrooms and zucchini for the veggies. I made an error and used cold broth, so that after 25 minutes it was much too soupy. I put the dish in the microwave for 4 minutes and that got it down to the right consistency to finish the dish. I did opt for using white wine, and if you choose to use apple juice instead, then I suggest that you add a teaspoon of a mild vinegar - wine is slightly acidic, and using a bit of vinegar helps substitute for that.",2011-02-24T20:53:47Z,2011-02-24T20:53:47Z

Generally I do not use celery as I don't like the texture, but I've just found that if I dice it very finely, I like it quite well. I used about half chicken broth instead of water, and would add a bay leaf, perhaps some savory or thyme next time to round out the flavor. I plan to add some spinach to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, as I think that would work out well.",2011-02-24T20:57:03Z,2011-02-24T20:57:03Z

1194890,368384,369715,bmcnichol,4,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written using flounder and using panko instead of bread crumbs as that is all I had. The breading didn't stick well to the fish and it burnt at places but we still enjoyed it. I did cut back on the pepper to 1/4 teaspoon and didn't add the optional pepper as I don't like things too spicy.,2011-02-24T21:04:08Z,2011-02-24T21:04:08Z

I took mine out at about 40 minutes because they looked cooked, but mine wasn't quite ready, the other one was but not mine. So it definitely needed 45 and a bit more. Personally I think they should be cooked right away once the egg mixture is poured over them, I think the bread has too much time to get mushy if it just sits in the mixture and that could be why it didn't cook properly (JMO)...But the flavor was yummy on my friends.

Instead of just using regular button mushrooms I had used a 4oz package of gourmet blend mushrooms which added a really great flavor. I sauteed the onions a little bit with the mushrooms and prepared the mixture and brought it to work and assembled there for the oven.The corn tortillas really made a nice taste difference compared to the flour ones. All the flavors went so well together. I had baked these in the oven. But I will have to say I only had one problem with this recipe. I wish I didn't put any oil on the top or bottom, because we just found them too greasy on the outside. Is it because I did it in the oven and not on a grill?

I did add a bit more water to keep it from drying out but that is to be expected based on the sauce used and the fact I had a bit more beef than what was called for in the recipe.  That is one of the bonuses - you could add veggies to this and skip the beef, you can bulk up on more sauce or less, more cheese or less and truly make it your own lasagna dish with minimal effort.  We really enjoyed it and I know I'll make it again as it saved me so much time!

This amount of oil was not mentioned in the instructions. It dawned on me that this was to go into the pesto mixture, which I did. However to keep the fat down, I added just under a 1/2 cup of oil. I also sliced the chicken breasts after they were cooked and spread with the sambal oelek. It seemed a more manageable way to serve the entire dish. In future, I'll use 600 grams of noodles for 4 people. My packet of 450 grams just stretched to serve three of us. One last comment -- the sambal oelek really makes this dish.

I am one of the guilty ones who like to read all reviews before making a recipe and follow some of the popular changes reviewers had made.  This time I shouldn't have!  I first cut my flour down to 2 c. as other reviewers suggested.  Thankfully, I cooked one single cookie to test.  It was FLAT!  So I went ahead and added the other 1/2 c. to the batter and the rest turned out great.  So well that my fiance ate ALL but 2 of them last night and is making me stir up another batch as soon as I'm done with this review.  Let me say.. When he found out what I was making last night he was very disappointed and said he would not eat any of them.  (He absolutely hates pieces of fruit or nuts in any dessert!!!)  With that in mind, I only made one batch.  The first set came out of the oven and he went crazy!  Said he was sorry and that if I wanted any for myself I better mix up more!  Ha!  I did try the glaze on half of the cookies.  Both w/and w/o were excellent.  Your preference!!  I was going to try adding cherry juice, as suggested by some.  However, when chopping my cherries they produced enough juice through the chopped ones that was perfect for a pink color and cherry taste!  I just did not drain the cherries that I chopped and did not add additional juice.  I don't write many reviews, but felt I had to thank Dib's for this one!!  Must try and I promise you will enjoy guys and gals!!  I'm off to make more!  :)",2011-02-24T12:13:31Z,2011-02-24T12:13:31Z

However, I never attempted enchiladas before and refused to use the can sauce.  I don't know if someone could help me w/what I may have done wrong.  By the other reviews, it was probably just my lack of enchilada knowledge.  But the sauce was WAY to thick for me.  Nothing I did made it thinner.  I tried adding more broth and when I ran out of broth I tried water.  Nothing worked!  And I do like the sauce thick, but this was to where I had to spread it with a spoon and it was extremely hard to dip the tortillas.  I also felt it had virtually no flavor and tried adding additional spices with still not achieving the flavor I was looking for.  I even tried cocoa which was a suggested Mexican secret with many recipes.  Like I said, it was probably just me.  But my excitement moved to discouragement.

1194990,84516,1637364,TicoBraidwood,0,"This was fantastic, I tweaked a bit....here's what I did: First, after spraying PAM on a 16"" pizza pan, I sprinkled about 4 T of Bob's Red Mill coarse ground corn meal before the Mozzarella. This makes more of a 'pizza hut' type crispy crust in the end. Then I added 2 T of soy flour and 2 T of golden flax meal (golden flax has a milder taste) and 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum (to bind so it wouldn't be crumbly). These elements added a 'crust' effect I felt was missing the first time I tried the recipe. I used a 16"" pizza pan and put the cheese in for 5 minutes (before adding egg mixture) as previous reviewers have. To understand low carb baking, you must know that  you have to replace gluten when cooking with low carb flours (flax, soy, almond, etc). You may do this by any number of methods, the lowest carb being eggs or xanthan gum. You need an extremely small amount of xanthan gum (1/4-1/2 tsp) to achieve this, or eggs, or a combination of the two. I used all the eggs called for in this recipe PLUS 1/4 tsp of xanthan gum with the additional flours. Next time I'm using almond flour and soy flour and I'll let y'all know how it goes!

And it was still not enough sauce, so my suggestion to all is - double up on sauce.<br/><br/>Also, I always notice that it tastes citrusy at the restaurant and after Googling I did find that people are saying lime is used in the original recipe.

I actually used a 8.5 oz box of Jiffy cornbread mix and then added half the milk, vinegar, and oil called for in this recipe.  I wanted to make a more savory bread because I was using it to cover beans in a casserole dish.  I used balsamic vinegar, olive oil  and 1% milk and then only added about a tsp of salt and sugar since I was using the Jiffy mix (didn't need to add the baking powder etc.) Made a wonderful topping over the spicy beans.

I'm more of a meat guy, so for this to have enough flavor to make me take more than a couple of spoonfuls out of the pot to ""taste"" it...then I know it's a winner.  :-)  Changes I made...<br/>1. Instead of the can of plum tomatoes and the tomato paste, I did 1-14.5oz can of diced tomatoes (pureed them in my processor, but not too much), 2-8oz cans of tomato sauce, and 1-6oz can of tomato paste)...and then I doubled the amounts to make a bigger batch.<br/>2.  I added about half of a small onion in with the garlic to saute on low heat for more than the 15 seconds, more like 2 minutes...if your heat is low enough you won't have to worry about the browning and bitterness that can result of burning the garlic.<br/>3.  I used 2 Tablespoons of dried parsley, and 2 Tablespoons of Oregano (keep in mind I doubled this batch), I also added basil, onion powder, paprika, celery salt, splenda (on a diet) and a pinch of cayenne....so let's see, if it were to be a single batch, this would be the measurements I would have used. <br/>1 T Dried Parsley<br/>1 T Dried Oregano<br/>1 T Splenda<br/>1/2 t Dried Basil<br/>1/2 t Onion Powder<br/>1/2 t Paprika<br/>1/2 t Salt<br/>1/4 t Pepper<br/>1/4 t Celery Salt<br/>Pinch of Cayenne<br/>It sounds like I changed it a lot, but I really didn't...I used Merlot instead of cooking wine...you know what they say, never cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink yourself.

I used a rye with caraway seeds in it, and the caraway added a nice flavor of its own, enough that I'd consider putting a bit of caraway seed into the gravy next time.  I tied these with string, as I think that makes them easier to brown on all sides than using toothpicks.  I always have dried porcini on hand, and they were definitely a plus in this dish, adding flavor to both the filling and the gravy (using the soaking liquid). For the meat, I chose thin sliced bottom round, and as noted in the recipe, I had a bit of filling left over after filling the 1.6 pounds of meat.

Next time I will add another bell pepper and not add it to the pot until half way through the cooking time in order to preserve the flavor of it.  It seemed that the pepper was over cooked and lost a lot of flavor.  I thought that the sausage would be my favorite meat, but the chicken was wonderful.  I used 2 whole chicken breasts and 2 lbs smoked sausage.

But the result is a fine one indeed.<br/><br/>A few important caveats and ideas: 1. Be careful the way you grate the cheese if you are grating by hand. My advice is to grate it using the finest/smallest side of the cheese grater. If you opt for a slightly bigger grate, it affects the texture somewhat. Not enough to make it ""bad"", but probably in a way not in keeping with the recipe. Next time, I will grate it the finest way possible.<br/><br/>2. Consider putting the pine nuts in the oven on a sheet of aluminum foil or a pan for a few short minutes before using.  That's my wife's customary pesto/pine nut preparation method over here. You want them cooked overhead just long enough to release some oils but not long enough to burn. Then let them cool before using. -- This is a variation on the recipe but you might find it's a good one.",2011-02-25T12:28:00Z,2011-02-25T12:28:00Z

1195103,248472,1838261,VoiceOverAudio,4,"Yum! As a alternative from dark rum's molasses-leaning flavor (think Gosling's Black Seal, or Cruzan's Black Strap), sometime try a lighter - but still spiced- rum like Sailor Jerry. There are notes of vanilla in Sailor Jerry's that heighten the appleness (?) of the hard cider. I order a pint of cider & a shot of Sailor Jerry, sip down the cider an inch, and pour the shot into the cider. No ice. I call it a ""Jerry Bomb"", although actually dropping the shot glass into the pint isn't necessary. LOL",2011-02-25T14:27:53Z,2011-02-25T14:27:53Z

1195118,373627,1167873,HocoRuco,4,"I found that as written, this recipe was not quite right. I was only able to find chipotle paste so I used that instead. Using the paste, the sauce on the chicken was WAY too lime flavored so I added probably about another tablespoon or two of the chipotle. I also thought that the corn cakes were completely flavorless. I would definitely recommend adding a bit of sugar and maybe some jalapeno or chile peppers to the batter. I HATE raw red onions so I lightly sauteed mine before adding them to the chicken and I wish I had sauteed everything because I think it would have been much better if served warm. I also highly recommend serving the dish topped with shredded cheddar with guacamole and/or sour cream on the side. <br/>As written, 3 stars.

I did add an extra tablespoon of the mini chips - other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Used the sugar free strawberry jam.  I must say these do raise and spreed a lot, so be prepared for that when spacing them.  I didn't on my first batch and they ran into each other - but I fixed that on the second round.  The taste is VERY soft and chewy.

1195165,330255,502302,Chef Tweaker,3,I hate to write less than favorable review which is probably why I dragged my feet in getting it posted. :(<br/>A few problems with this... first too sweet. (and I like it sweet!) If I were to do it again I would try replacing the ketchup with tomato sauce. Also I cooked this for exactly 7 hrs (overnight so no stirring) and it was overcooked. I'll have to keep looking to find the sloppy joe recipe for me.,2011-02-25T19:15:58Z,2011-02-25T19:15:58Z

I should followed my instinct to add more bananas and something else to add flavor.  I did use applesauce & maple syrup to replace the apple juice.

I put some raw onion in the crockpot, on top of the meat. To the soup I added a half a can of water then the sour cream, I might have used more sour cream, I just kinda eyeballed it to the consistency that I liked. I also added minced garlic to the soup, then poured it all over the meat. I cooked on high for 4 hours as well, I had some bigger steaks. And let me tell you that you didnt even need a knife to cut it! So tender and delicious!!! I served it over egg noodles with some green beans on the side, and that worked out perfect.

If you would like t make ahead, melt butter, add cream cheese & milk & keep warm. You can  hold off on adding the Parmesan until a few minutes before serving. This approach worked out great for me.

When cooking the veggies I was certain they were burning -but some just blackened a bit and there wasn't any carbon taste -much to my relief. Because I know what flavors we like best I took out the ginger and 1/2 of the coriander seeds.  And next time I will either buy smaller potatoes or cut them smaller because I wanted more seasoning flavor instead of plain potato.

1195192,354466,874035,Karen Cox 2,5,"YUM - My family loved this. Made a few changes just due to what I had on hand. I didn't have any green onions or fresh ginger on hand so use a onion powder and ground ginger instead. I used a half and half combo of flour and cornstarch for the coating. Used fresh lemon and orange. The only purposeful change I made was to double the amount of red pepper, might use even more next time as we like things spicy. Also I don't have a deep fryer or wok so just cooked the chicken in 3 batches in a regular heavy pan, it probably came out a little less ""bready"" than deep frying but we liked it that way. This was an easy recipe for someone that is not an expert cook, and was so good! Most recipes seem to not have enough sauce - this had plenty. I will keep this in minde for next time we have company.

I halved the recipe and used 1/3 cup sugar and brown basmati rice (so the first soak was 40 minutes.) I was worried at first because all my water hadn't absorbed after the 20-minute soak with the saffron, rosewater, and oil. I added some slivered almonds and raw pistachio pieces then let it simmer on low heat, uncovered, for 35 minutes. Because I made half, the mixture fit perfectly in an 8"" pie pan-- I let it sit out for 10 minutes to gel a bit before I topped it with more slivered almonds and some cinnamon, I snuck a little bit while it was still warm and it DOES have a Jello-like consistency! Then I let it refridgerate overnight (uncovered) and it was even better the next day, wonderful with some strawberries on the side.

I followed the recipe exactly as described, but put the lamb and all of the marinade ingredients (once well-mixed) into a Ziploc  bag and kept in in the fridge for two days!   (turning it over every now and then)  Anyway, great flavor and so so SO tender!  A note about cooking times:  I had a small-ish 2.5 lb boneless roast (you know, like with all the string and fat and everything) and I cooked it at 375 degrees for 1 hour and 7 mins and it was perfect . .. nice and pink and very juicy!

I expected that this one would be something I would settle for, knowing that it is low carb and phase one suitable....but I thought that it was great!  Fast, easy and with great texture, just needing some flavour tweakings for personal preference it truely deserves a 5 star.  I noticed that the recipe had been submitted in 2007, and since microwaves are now stronger in power, I cooked my muffin for only 1 minute and 15 seconds which was just perfect.  It remained moist, but fully cooked, and with a texture not unlike a sponge cake, which to me is a good thing!

I also added 1 cup of mini baking M&Ms to them, which added some cute colors, and oh my gosh, more sweetness! I think next time I make these, I'll reduce the white sugar by 1/2 cup. The baking time was perfect for me at 10 minutes on the top third of my conventional oven. I used a cookie scoop and didn't flatten them before baking, and in the oven they flattened (but not too-crisp-flat - just normal cookie-flat).

This got mixed reviews from my family (DS is currently anti-oatmeal and DH thought it a bit sweet) but we all agreed it should get all the stars for texture, health, and basic flavor. We don't like a lot of sugar in the morning so I cut it back to 1/4 c with no sugar garnish and honestly I wish I had reduced it more. The bananas add a lovely natural sweetness, so it might even work with just a tiny bit sprinkled on at the end. I forgot to reduce the milk in order to add pineapple so I skipped that, and since I don't care for cooked raisins I just sprinkled them on top of DH and DS's bowls along with the banana.

The texture is a bit different from a ""regular"" angel food cake and that's a good thing.  The cake has substance without being the least bit tough or chewy.  It's sweet but not overly sweet.  ""Creamy"" is an excellent word to describe it.  WONDERFUL with fresh berries but just as good on it's own.  My SIL snacked on it like it was a cookie.  She even had it for breakfast!  This particular cake ended up being extremely well traveled.  Sweetie is a truck driver and takes his own food on the road.  He took over a third of this cake on his most recent trip.  This cake was enjoyed in So Cal, Oregon and Yakama, Washington.  It was then consumed in Boise, Idaho and finally Utah.

It made the dish taste like a chicken parm casserole! I also added chopped bell pepper to the sauce and used red wine instead of white. I think next time, I'll try either fresh tomatoes or canned diced instead of the can of stewed tomatoes - I'm just not a fan of the large, large chunks in the sauce. I used reduced fat mozz cheese and grated romano instead of parmesan (just a personal preference.) Overall, this is a wonderful recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

I did have to add a little broth but probably because I used rice that was already cooked instead of fresh.  Anyway it was quite tasty.

1195306,110790,49974,Qzak5419,5,"OMG. I grew up eating golumpkis. Mom made hers just a tiny bit different but these are phenomenal as well! I did however do a couple of things that mom did. Instead of using tomato sauce I used 3-10 oz cans of Campbell's tomato soup (I like LOTS of juice), diluted just a bit (one can's worth) with some of the water the cabbage cooked in. By using soup, I did not add any additional salt plus I only added about a1 tsp. of brown sugar as I think the soup is sweetened a smidge already. I also laid a couple of bay leaves on top of the golumpkis before cooking. Remove the bay leaves when done. Lastly, mom used a pressure cooker to cook her golumpkis. Takes 12-15 minutes cooking time after pressure is reached. I then turn the heat off and leave cooker on the stove for another 5-7 mins. (I have a big pressure cooker that was filled nearly to the top with golumpkis.) Then I run cold water over the top of the cooker. This cools the cooker quickly and releases any remaining pressure. Open up the cooker and dig in. Very yummy! I love cooking with a pressure cooker. It's the old school version of a microware. Cooks super fast and everything is amazingly tender.",2011-02-26T15:17:02Z,2011-02-26T15:17:02Z

Oh, and fusilli instead of bow tie, each of which I broke in half, as sweetie likes fusilli or rotini best. My tomato just was not optimal, even though I bought it several days ahead of time.

I cut it into cubes before starting to help it get to room temperature more quickly.

Other than that I followed the recipe as it's written. My peppers must have been smaller than those used by the author of the recipe because I had some meat mixture left over which was also delicious when fried up. DD was home for dinner and using this recipe as the inspiration, I made a vegetarian version where a rice and refried bean mixture was used in place of the ground beef/pork.

I made this tonight and thought it was easy enough and if it didn't work out I would just make a teriyaki recipe that I had tried before. Had all the ingredients except for pineapple & I was so disappointed so I used Orange Juice and no water to the cornstarch. I also added some orange peel seasoning, 2 T fresh ginger, red pepper flakes and sauce was outstanding. My Chinese restaurant  makes a thick wonderful sweet sauce like this and I was in heaven being able to duplicate such a close match. I also put a drop or two of dry sherry. Couldn't have been happier tonight cause I was really wanting chinese. I fried the chicken and added onion and green pepper I seasoned with olive oil, garlic and a little ginger.  After I made the fried chicken balls, I mixed them into the thick sauce with the green pepper, onion, and used green onions to top it.

First, the goods are: appearance, simplicity and variety. It was colorful, easy to make, and had several delicious veggies, including one of my faves (broccoli).  I also found it was not bland, which often can be a problem in pasta salads.  I made the exact recipe, and served it to four adults, and it was barely sufficient to give everyone a decent sized serving.  There were no left overs, and if I were serving this to 5-6 or more people, I would double the recipe.

I can't wait to use this seasoning, thanks!

1195556,19177,881125,Brontewyn,4,"I think the 1/2 tsp salt is an error.  It seemed very low compared to the amount of salt I put into recipes of similar size, so I used a full tsp, which still seemed low, and it still was bland.  Nor was the absence of other seasoning a problem as I used a heaping Tbs of curry, a tsp and a half of hot sauce, as well as the black pepper.  Next time I'll use a tsp and a half or two tsps of salt.  <br/><br/>I used a low fat coconut milk, because that's all Trader Joe's had.  No doubt that affected the flavor as well, but I'm not going to change that until I get the salt level right, and may not change this at all.  <br/><br/>Couple of other changes: (1) I got started too late in the day so I set the crock pot on high and cooked for 4 hours rather than low for 6-8.  This worked out fine. (2) I used skinless, boneless thighs rather than breasts as I prefer the flavor and I get annoyed at our country's unwillingness to utilize the full chicken.  My companion usually complains about chicken thighs--with the skin they can be greasy--but he did not complain at all in this case.  Indeed, he did not seem to notice.  (3) We went out and were not home when it was time to add the peas.  I was actually going to use green beans, as pictured, but I didn't add either.  Nor did I end up making rice or noodles, due to time constraints.  <br/><br/>All this said, it was good enough and simple enough that I will try again.",2011-02-27T17:07:25Z,2011-02-27T17:07:25Z

As someone who's tried many regular recipes for spinach and artichoke dip, and someone who has eaten many many many versions in my life (both great and incredibly bad) I was not expecting this to be so good! I made just a couple minor subs. I only had shallots, so I used 2 of those for the onion. And I used 1/2 veg cream cheese, and 1/2 veg sour cream. Needed some salt and pepper, and used matzo meal for the panko (was the only bread crumb - esk thing I had) THANK YOU KOSMIC!!",2011-02-27T19:16:55Z,2011-02-27T19:16:55Z

1195608,338498,1169153,TinkerToy,4,"This is VERY good and much easier than the traditional recipe with boiled potatoes I usually make. However, my dough was WAY too moist. I probably used about 3 cups of flour, not including the flour I used on the table to stretch it into ropes. I would make a couple of suggestions to avoid this:1) Make sure you use enough potato flakes, or perhaps even slightly mound your measurements. This will ensure a proper thickness to the dough without having to over-add flour, which can make it tough. 2) let the dough rest a little while before roping/pinching to give it a chance to cool. I found that as the dough cooled off, it was stiffer and much more manageable. 3) Make your gnocchi",2011-02-27T19:23:04Z,2011-02-27T19:23:04Z

I was short on eggs and well knew I more than likely would not use the yolks so used 1 whole egg and mixed with 2 heaped teaspoons of Dijon mustard, as I am the only one really crazy about it and to the dried bread crumbs I added some finely chopped fresh basil, oregano and garlic and an 1/8th cup of finely grated aged parmesan (same again I am the only one crazy for it but think I may get away with the full amount next time).  Didn't worry about the flour with using whole egg and when I baked at 200C fan forced I gave them a very light spray with extra virgin olive oil to help the crisping process of the crumbs and think I could have done with about 3 to 5 minutes less for my chicken breasts which weighed about 210 grams each or maybe turn the temperature down by about 10 to 15 degrees C.

After removing the duck, pour off any remaining fat, return pan to heat and deglaze with red wine, a bit of balsamic and i used cherry preserves stirred until mixed and reduced to consistency of a medium to thin gravy.

I did the same to the pan before placing the rolls in it. I totally agree with dancejennie...put more powdered sugar in the mixture for the icing. I still prefer the old-fashioned, yeast cinnamon rolls, but this is a good alternative. No problem with the dough being too sticky or hard to roll. The dough was soft and rolled easily. Perhaps those that found it too sticky put a bit too much milk in it or didn't use enough flour on the rolling board, the rolling pin, or their hands (when removing from the bowl).

The fudge taste over-powered the liqueur, so I'll stick to regular chocolate frosting next time.

I did use fresh mushrooms as some of the other reviewers suggested, and I wish I would have sauteed them a little longer than the recipe says--they were still pretty firm when we ate them, and the mushrooms at Carrabba's are pretty cooked down and soft. Also, the sauce did turn out a little thin, but perhaps more corn starch next time could fix that. Also, I think I will add a little browning sauce (Kitchen Bouquet brand) next time to try and darken the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe since we were using more chicken, and it made enough sauce to feed four adults plus have some leftover.

1195937,97523,88717,Ms. Cooky,1,"Update: These were great when I made them, but the next day they were dry and the glaze soaked in them. I had to throw them away. So if you make them, eat them the same day. I'm going to look for another recipe.<br/><br/>This is the exact same recipe I received with my mini electric doughnut maker. A few tips I learned: using my mini doughnut maker they baked in 2 minutes. Any more time than that and they are tough. The recipe made about 43 minis. The icing I made was: 1 cup powdered sugar (sifted for lumps), 2 tablespoons of hot water and 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. If using pure vanilla and/or pure almond extracts, I start out with less and add more if I need to. I tinted half with one drop of red food coloring to make pink and the other half I left plain. This was a perfect amount of glaze/icing for this recipe. Only dip about 4 doughnuts and then add the sprinkles. Otherwise the icing hardens and the sprinkles fall off. I found out the hard way. :) I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. They turned out very pretty. Oh, if you are using an electric mini doughnut maker, use about 1 teaspoon of batter. When you close the lid, they will turn into doughnuts. I just used a chop stick to remake the hole in the center. Easier than trying to miss the middle.

It had a rise in the oven too and smelled like real wheat bread when it was baking.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor but the texture is great and the crust really crusty.  I tried using it for Brushetta and it worked great.  I can see this being a good bread for french toast, french dip bread or even to make stuffing or bread pudding.

However, I learned a few things by making your recipe; like pre-cooking the tofu in salt water, so it will not break apart easily. I also have to say that I did not follow this recipe exactly (sorry to say, but it has to be a 5 star one) and used ingredients which I already had on hand.  I used ground chicken, Sichuan Spicy Noodle Sauce (fermented soybeans, chili), chili paste with garlic, added some garlic cloves, spring scallions, fermented black beans (more then the recipe called for)...and Harveys Bristol Cream. The spicy flavors and taste was excellent and surely was a 5 star meal !  Finally, if you are looking for a Mapo Tofu which is a nice combination of Japanese-Chinese flavors, make sure you follow the ingredients listed... for a great recipe! <br/>P.S.

1196031,447151,705251,HokiesMom,4,This bread has a lovely flavor but the texture is a bit too dense for our liking.  Right out of the oven they were soft and light but the next morning we found them just too dense.  When I warmed them it was better so I'm wondering if a bit more applesauce would help with the moisture/texture of the bread or using just a bit of all purpose flour instead of 100% all wheat flour.  I think I would also add a bit more cinnamon or maybe some nutmeg as that flavor really was not as strong as I'd like.  Overall a very nice quick bread.  I made it into 6 lovely muffins as I only have a mini pan set of 4 (have to use all 4) so used my decorative muffin pan and adjusted the baking time down to 15 minutes and they were cooked perfectly.

The label listed the weight as 439 g but after rinsing and draining the beans weighed just under the 300g that the recipe called for.) I also didn't soak the bulgur for the whole hour.

Any sort of fresh peppers chopped up do well. Trying to eat the meat from a ham hock is fine if you are broke. The human stomach is perfectly suited to the exercise. Since I am not destitute, I wrap the ham hock(s) in cheesecloth and toss them with the bay leaves. If you want pieces of meat, use large chunks of ham and shred them at the end down to bite size. Or country style ribs. Or whatever you have laying around. But don't pass on the ham hocks. (Bacon and liquid smoke will work, kinda.)

I had to more than double the water to get any kind of dough out of this which I did on my own but on finding other recipes found they all required at least 1 part water to 4 parts flour. Because I had to mess around with it far more than I should have the dough was tough to work with. The only thing saved the rating on this was the meat filling turned out lovely. I added half a head of cauliflower while cooking the meat to hide some veggies from my kids and used ground chicken instead of ground beef. After boiling the kreplach in chicken broth instead of water it tasted nice but I'll know better next time for the dough. I'll probably actually just find another recipe, sorry.

My boys added some Doritos in their bowls, ds10 gave it 4 starts and said it's a keeper, ds8 was luke-warm but did enjoy the broth it produced.

My boys aren't crazy about obvious ground flax so I mixed it in with granola and they didn't even notice. I also gave them a ""surprise"" centre, with a couple big spoonfuls of fresh blueberries under the yogurt. Set the apples up in a circle like I saw in another photo and they just thought it was great, pre-dipped apples and yummy yogurt. Some reviewers mentioned using whole flax seed. Just a gentle reminder that we don't really digest it whole, it's too hard and too small so very little of the amazing benefits are seen. I buy my flax whole as whole does keep better than ground and grind it as needed in a coffee grinder saved just for the purpose of grinding seeds and nuts only (I do keep small jars pre-ground in the fridge to save time, I use it lots :) ).

1196134,295781,496803,IngridH,4,"For flavor, these would merit 5 stars, but I had to increase the breadcrumbs by half to coat all of the wings.  I cut the recipe in half, as I was dining alone, (intending half of the recipe to be the next day's lunch), and the serving size was perfect.  However, after coating 2/3 of my wings in the crumb/sesame mixture, I needed to measure out another 1/4 portion to coat the remaining wing pieces.  This may be because I used panko flakes, which are lighter in texture and fill a larger volume for the same amount of bread, but anyway, once all the wings were coated, they baked up beautifully.  I cooked for less time than specified, my wings hit 165F at about 30 minutes, so I pulled them from the oven.  Please don't rely on my timing, use a thermometer and check for doneness.

The DM tried one from each batch and thought they were all good and were buttery but the more cooked ones were a bit dry, so will be making again in the future but keeping a much closer eye on that timer.

1196191,131018,138686,Redox,5,"For people like me who don't have a large enough crock pot, here's how I cooked this recipe. I put a 5 ¾ pound center-cut pork loin roast into a 7 qt. enameled cast-iron pot. I see no reason why any oven suitable pot wouldn't work just fine, though. Before starting I used the pork rub from recipe #28316 on this site and liberally patted it onto all surfaces of the roast. I cut the roast in half to fit it in the pot and then browned it on all sides to develop some flavor -- Hah! Try that in your crock pot ;) I put it into a pre-heated 300° F oven for three hours. (It's my understanding that modern crock pots cook at 300° on High and 200° on Low. I could be wrong, though). I was just trying to simulate the Auto-Shift setting on my old slow cooker that starts on High to speed up the cooking and then shifts to Low after 3 hours. I was just jockeying the temperature around to try to get the pulled pork done by supper time. I didn't have 14 to 16 hours to do this. After 3 hours, I turned the oven down to 275 ° for another 3 ½ hours.  I was worried it might not be tender in time for our meal if I turned it down to 300°. I took the now very tender pork out of the pot and pulled it apart with two forks. It was very easy since I used boneless pork loin. Back into the pot it went along with a bottle of Baby Ray's and about half an additional bottle of Famous Dave's. This tasted great! Thanks so much for posting this. I will make this again...and again. Boneless center-cut pork loin goes on sale around here often for approximately $1.60 to $1.99 per pound so it's pretty economical and lower fat than pork shoulder or butt. I'm thinking about getting a new pressure cooker and I'll bet I could do this recipe with about 90 minutes of cooking time. If it works I'll post the results here, it anyone is interested.",2011-03-01T13:09:29Z,2011-03-01T13:09:29Z

I used Splenda instead of sugar and Trader Joe's Low-Sodium Garden Patch vegetable juice instead of tomato soup, used half red wine vinegar and half Balsamic vinegar, two cloves of minced garlic, olive oil instead of canola, and added fresh ground pepper. This sounds like a lot of changes, but the basic idea is the same. I will make this all the time now. So easy. I just stirred it in a measuring cup instead of putting it in the blender, and that worked fine. I like that there is a relatively low oil-to-other-liquids ratio, it makes a lot, and tastes good.

1196209,20311,1221917,Feisty Redhead,5,"I just finished making this cake. I love how fast and easy it is to mix up - just one bowl for clean-up is ALWAYS a winning aspect of a recipe for me! The cakes baked up beautifully and evenly. I didn't have cake flour and since the recipe noted an alternate for when you don't have cake flour I went ahead and did that rather than make cake flour substitute. The only problem I had was that I could not get the cakes to release from the pans. One layer wound up falling apart. I couldn't get the other one out either so instead of continuing to try I decided to leave it in the pan to frost and decorate. I did grease and flour my pans... but I only did so lightly. Perhaps if they were heavily greased and floured instead the cakes would have released. I will try that next time, and I may line the bottoms of the pans with parchment as well. (And yes there will be a next time for this recipe!) The flavor is wonderful - light and not too sweet. The texture is lovely as well - moist but slightly crumbly, airy yet dense - it's just right in all aspects. It is a fragile cake though - so use care when handling the layers.

I picked this recipe because my boys had come back from Mexico raving about the omelettes they had there, so I thought, nice easy weeknight dinner or weekend brunch. Wasn't feeling the best today so weeknight dinner it was. So easy to make and it was a huge hit. I didn't have buttermilk so used two tbsp milk and 1 tbsp my own yogurt, used extra large free range eggs fresh from the farm so it made lots. I didn't have cheddar so used mozza to mix in and on top the boys and added ricotta to mine. I fried up some bacon pieces and cut up some veggies for everyone to pick what they liked. Also had some chicken filling leftover from kreplach the other night. Definitely a keeper for an easy meal anytime of the day. Ds10 even asked for more and his was huge!

I was looking to make a baked bean recipe because I'd never tried homemade before and I came across this and if it hadnt been Kittencal's recipe I probly wouldnt have tried it. So delicous everybody loved it. The changes I made were leaving out the capsicums (bell peppers) and jalapeno's. Added more garlic and extra mince. Served it on wraps with lettuce and sour cream. One tip for people looking for a litle bit of a healtier recipe it would'nt make a difference if you skipped the cheddar cheese on top TY Kittencal,2011-03-01T22:43:24Z,2011-03-01T22:43:24Z

The strawberry was a bit light so added a little extra and also a little more sugar - thought what I added didn't really make it sweet. Low/non-fat items often substitute sugar for fat so that could be why this was still pretty tart, though I enjoyed that contrast with the sweetness of the banana I dipped in it.

1196391,382149,200862,Zurie,3,"MADE FOR PAC, March 2011. Dear AskCy, this recipe is very hard for me to review. As my adopted cook, I'd love to give you 5 stars for every recipe!! This one made it to ""good"" (3 stars). It is perfectly nice, very easy, real comfort food, but the taste is very ordinary. Normally I would have added lots of herbs and maybe chillies, but I wanted us to taste your recipe as you wrote it. AskCy, maybe my biggest problem is with your cooking method, and I wonder if you'd consider editing your recipe? The litre of beef stock would have been FAR too much: I added 1 cup! (250 ml). (Did you make a mistake with that litre?) In the photos you can hopefully see 250 ml was enough, as the veggies also shed some liquid. I also have a problem with your cooking times. No ways could I cook this dish, after adding the peas, ""for a good hour""!! I added the peas once the baby potatoes was almost tender, and it took literally minutes for the peas and potatoes to be perfect after that, and I removed it from the heat. A small point, but maybe worth mentioning for the 5-star recipes you are still going to post for us: list your ingredients in the order in which they will be used, i.e. oil first. The title: it puzzled me a little (this is not a criticism!) as we would never call a mince dish a ""stew"". One associates a stew with chunks of meat. But never mind that.

1196393,397689,228458,smellyvegetarian,5,"Yum! This was a delicious and filling meal. Per Deb's advice I added two extra eggs to help fill up DH, but to my surprise we didn't really need them. I did reduce the olive oil to 1 T, and I substituted mushrooms and green beans for the eggplant as I can't stand eggplant ;). I also added a few handfuls of collard greens that needed to be used up when I added the beans. The cheese really takes this over the top, so use good quality parm. Thanks for the keeper, Pat!

I actually used my indoor grill pan, which worked great, as we haven't has a chance to fire up our outdoor grill this season yet. I only had a few chicken tenderloins left in the bag, so I used 6 chicken tenderloins (chicken tenders), I didn't pound them or anything, and I marinated them in the sauce for about 9 hours. The recipe didn't say to reserve sauce that raw chicken didn't marinate in (for the brushing on after), so I just cooked them (4 min. on each side) and served them with extra picante sauce. I served them with broccoli and crescent rolls. Thanks, I'll be keeping this one. Made for Spring PAC 2011.",2011-03-02T09:05:59Z,2011-03-02T09:05:59Z

1196519,69871,1510765,Sisyphus Cypher,5,"This is a wonderful, flexible recipe that gives so many options. I like it for using leftovers or on days that I need something easy. Unlike a quiche, you don't need to make a separate crust. It tastes like quiche, though. If you want a very easy cleanup line your dish with tin foil and spray with Pam or some such oil spray. The leftovers can be heated gently for lunch the next day. I like to add white pepper to this dish as it adds a more delicate flavor and heat. I've made it for friends when we've had little money. My sons and father like it also which makes it a good meal when I need to feed them. <br/>Red pepper sauteed or chopped goes well with the egg, cheese and ham. Any vegetable goes well with this dish except cruciferous vegetables which are too strongly flavored. Cut the vegetables up well enough so that the pie does not pull apart messily when you serve it especially spinach or chard. Next time I intend to use a spring form pan to see if I can make it even easier to cut and serve. Thank you for the excellent recipe Andy Wold.",2011-03-01T00:21:36Z,2011-03-01T00:21:36Z

The dressing I left as simple as it is here. Instead of raisins I used Craisins. I like the zest which contrasts nicely with the sweet dressing. I also added cinnamon candied pecans chopped irregularly. Everyone loved it and it didn't last long in the fridge. I recommend cutting the broccoli into florets that are bit size and smaller. Use some of the inner broccoli stem, julienne it and add to the salad to vary texture. I hate to see good food go to waste. The skin of the broccoli stem is tough so peel it off.

My family and I certainly enjoyed this, and think it is definitely worth making again. I made this for Spring PAC 2011.",2011-03-01T22:20:08Z,2011-03-01T22:20:08Z

I used skinless chicken breast as it was what I had on hand last night.  I also flipped the chicken after 30 minutes so both sides had a chance to absorb that yummy sauce.  The sauce is bold in flavor and delicious. Don't be afraid to use the full amounts of spices.

I first made the buttermilk, using a splash of lemon juice mixed with my milk, then I cut in the fats while the milk was sitting.

Just wish I could get a refund. 8 eggs and all of that chocolate was not cheap.<br/>OK, I went back and tried this recipe again using only 2 ounces of unsweetened chocolate and I substituted margarine in place of butter just in case it turned out bad again.

I used brown sugar, butter, McIntosh apples and some canola oil on the topping to help it brown. I added the lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the apples, which worked well. I should have used firmer apples and left the peel on (forgot to do), so juice sat at the bottom of the pan. Also, it would have been better if the topping stuck together, instead of the just being a sprinkled oat layer. However, it tasted great, so the presentation did not really matter.

I used ground turkey as that is what I have been buying lately to help cut back on fatty foods and I think I had a little more than what was called for in this recipe.  We didn't have just diced tomatoes, but had diced tomaotes with diced green chilies.  As a personal choice I added a dash of cumin, and garlic powder.  We skipped putting it into the oven as my hubby doesn't eat cheese and I'm not a velveeta fan, instead I just sprinkled a little extra sharp cheddar cheese on my serving. This turned out terrific!

I cooked it the right amount of time, the top was a little cracked, and the test stick did come out :somewhat dry"" but it was the bottom after I cut is that seemed to be the issue.  Probably the wetness of the banana. If I decide to make this again, I will try cooking it longer and see what happens. Overall, we liked it the taste, and perhaps in the next couple of days, it will dry and as it gets a little bit ""stale.""  I  do have to mention two things to note in the recipe that need to be fixed:  the ingredients have the water listed  twice and for two different amounts. Because I always assume that the ingredients are in the ""order"" of the directions.  That was 3/4 cup.  The next time it appeared, it was for only 1/2 cup and I did not add it again, of course.  Perhaps the 3/4 vs. the 1/2 made a difference in the ""wetness"" problem. One of those water ingredients needs to be removed from the list.  The other problem is that it does not mention when to add the pecans.  I figured, that like all other recipes that call for nuts, they are added at the very end.  I did that, but the directions should include all of the ingredients. I did not include those things in my rating.  Thanks for posting.",2011-03-03T01:20:42Z,2011-03-03T01:20:42Z

I may have used more red peppers, because I baked mine at high heat, as I wanted to peel off the skins before using in the soup. So to make up for that shrinkage I used 3 red peppers. Otherwise, all I changed was to use Tabasco instead of pepper, I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, my soup needed a little more salt, and I added dried basil because I was out of fresh. What can I say? It was a tasty soup, Chef AskCy, thanks!",2011-03-03T05:19:36Z,2011-03-03T05:19:36Z

I also added some salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to give it some taste. I did a small test batch of mushrooms, just 3 or 4, to get the seasoning adjusted before frying up the rest of the veggies (red and yellow bell pepper strips, cauliflower, mushrooms, onions, and zucchini). For a little added zip a dash or two of Tony Chachere's is perfect! (11)",2011-03-03T06:36:16Z,2011-03-03T06:36:16Z

1196772,365093,724516,Tea Jenny,5,"Mmmm, I Really liked these muffins. I made a few changes to fit in with my diet as I am a diabetic but the bones of the recipe were still there. First I used half wholemeal flour and half white ,then I used splenda blend for the sugars and I used just the egg white and a non hydrogenated spread suitable for baking, also a wee bit more rising agent because of the w/w flour as sometimes it can make things a bit heavier and my bacon was very lean. These are really nice muffins and I don't think anyone would notice the changes as they are quite subtle and I can have some. Thank you for posting a really yummy muffin recipe I think I will be making this a lot it was a big hit with everyone not just me and they were non the wiser that they were tweaked.

I must say that I've been intimidated with the thoughts of making a cheesecake in regards to whether or not to use a water bath & how long to cook it, but after some research I found that the reason why this recipe does not call for a water bath is because of the flour.  Cheesecakes with cornstarch or flour added to the batter do not crack as easily from overbaking. The starch molecules will actually get in between the egg proteins preventing them from over-coagulating. No over-coagulating, no cracks!!  So I did as the recipe stated & only put it in a pan therefore no cracks.

I prefer to drain the fat off the beef instead of cooking it with the rest of the ingredients, so I browned and drained the beef, stirred in everything else and then transferred it to a casserole dish.  The top of the potatoes didn't get browned and crispy with the non-stick cooking spray, so for the last 5 minutes I brushed a little melted butter on top and I'll do that again next time.  :)  Thanks for sharing, Messiejessie!

I didn't use bamboo shoots as the tin I thought was bamboo shoots was actually water chestnuts and I had everything ready to make it before I noticed but it was still very good, The cornflower makes the chicken silky smooth and very tender, and the sherry gives it that nice richness. I served it with w/w egg noodles and the two went very well together. I will be making this again as it's very quick to put together.

It was super easy to prepare and the flavor is outstanding, probably better than you've had at most restaurants. I used haddock with fantastic results. You can probably use almost any fish you would like. The only other change I made was to reduce butter by half and when I make it again I will do the same, because I can't imagine this fish tasting any better than it did. What I also love about this recipe is that it's easy to do for a dinner party. I can prepare it in advance and then just pop it in the oven. I can't wait to serve it to my friends.

I did make one change though, since I'm on a low carb diet I chose to use a tomato sauce rather than juice to make the marinade into a thicker sauce and dipped the shrimp in it rather than marinate. Lower carb intake that way. I just chopped the olives and added them to the mix rather than mix them w/ regular cocktail sauce.

I had to add 1/2 cup of skim milk so it would have a decent texture. I did make a few modifications but those shouldn't have affected the consistency. I used cocoa instead of carob powder, subbed part of the soymilk powder with ground flaxseed and some berry-green powder, and used corn syrup instead of honey (honey's just too expensive to experiment with). I also nuked (30 sec) the peanut butter/syrup so it would be easier to mix. The flavour is quite good, but if you're expecting something sweet, you'll need to add more sweetener, or shape into balls and roll in some powdered sugar.

It did not rise as much as regular bread but I think that is to be expected with the gluten free.  I did add a tad more flour; about 1/2 cup and I used agave nectar in lieu of the sugar.

For the mushroom marinade, I put a ziploc bag into a clean glass, and draped the zippy part over the rim (I included a picture - this made it easy to put liquids into a baggie). I am not sure how long I marinated my mushroom - haha that sounds funny - but I put it in the fridge and just took it out when the onions were almost done, so I could grill it. I used my stovetop grill pan and grilled it for about 3 1/2 minutes on each side. I only put mayo on one slice of bread (I'm not really a fan of it), and I didn't really think it needed it, personally. I would leave it off next time. I had a bunch of onion marmalade leftover. It would be very good on teriyaki chicken sandwiches - if you're not totally into the vegetarian thing. The flavors of this are definitely tangy and meaty, very much like a Reuben! I am keeping this recipe, and I would make it for my mom when she comes over for lunch. I'm glad I picked this one - sorry for the honkin' long review!

I then sauteed the onions, diced peppers, garlic, and added mushrooms, in the bacon grease with the addition of 1 tbs oil. I added un-cooked minute rice to the mix as it cooks perfectly during baking, and a little mozzarella.  I doubled the amount of basil and oregano to give a more intense flavor.  With 15 minutes bake time remaining, I sprinkled the top with a little more mozzarella.

There's another recipe I've made a few times that uses a little milk, and I was a little skeptical that this recipe didn't. It might be subjective, but I think these eggs turned out a little ""solider"" than the other recipe, and maybe even cooked a bit faster - it seemed like it was ready in just a couple of minutes. The eggs might have been a tad on the blander side, not having milk in them, but they were still good.

What a lucky find for me....I enjoyed this tonight using dried porcini and sliced fresh baby portabellas for my mushrooms.  I had a bit over 8 oz of skirt steak, but didn't reduce the mushrooms and sauce!  My skirt steak was a bit thinner than one inch, so I reduced the cooking time, making this even quicker to prepare on a weeknight after work. I've never made skirt steak without marinating it before, so sort of wondered about this.  The steak was not as tender as I would have liked (may have just been my meat), but the taste is sublime.  I'll definitely make this one again....so quick, delicious, and easy to make!  I can see several uses for this sauce in the future!!! Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe!

Finding myself plumb out of ancient, rancid, sheep butter, (smen) I left it out, and don't think I missed anything by doing so.  If I had Moroccan blood in my veins, I probably would have noticed.  I used the pressure cooker, but really, it didn't add anything except complexity.  Any reasonable cut of beef could have been cooked in the American stewpot until soft, with the same result.  I suspect the original recipe called for camel, horse, or jackel meat that might have needed higher heat.<br/><br/>I thickened the gravy with cornstach/water and the flavor was excellent.  I served it over couscous with a side dish of cabbage in a caraway flavored white sauce.  My wife and I licked the pot clean!",2011-03-03T22:00:38Z,2011-03-03T22:00:38Z

I didn't have any problems with my crackers crumbling at all that way. I did have one question, however...was I supposed to drain the nuts after I soaked them or was I supposed to process them liquid and all?

I always use ""fresh"" Parmesan which I finely grate with a rasp so it melts easily. I tossed in crumbled bacon at the end that I keep frozen from Kittencal's Oven Bacon recipe.

While on vacation, I even cooked a batch the night before so we could enjoy it for a quick early breakfast. I stopped spraying the foil & the bacon still lifts up easily. I found draining the grease before putting a new layer of bacon on the tray, reduces burning & mess in the oven. I strain the grease then pour it into an ice cube tray & once frozen, transfer it to a freezer bag. I freeze bacon to crumble into salads, roasted veggies, BLT sandwiches, etc... My son-in-law thought it wouldn't taste the same but I served it to him for New Year's brunch & he couldn't tell it was previously frozen.

Otherwise followed recipe but next time would just use 125ml chicken stock in place of chicken noodle soup mix (don't normally have packet soup mixes in the pantry but this was a left over from a recipe I did for the DS's recreation group), I used spring onions as that was all I had and also added the liquid to the flour curry powder mix (after frying of for a few minutes to make sure the flour was cooked) and whisked till smooth and thickened and then added salmon and heated through and continued as per recipe.  My chutney was a mango chutney (will cut back on that for us a little too sweet) but overall a good recipe that delivers some flavours that meld well together.  I served mine with a simple salad on the side and had a very satisfying meal, thank you mummamills, made for Aussie/Kwi Recipe Swap #50 March 2011.",2011-03-04T07:01:53Z,2011-03-04T07:01:53Z

I followed the directions with only 2 minor changes.  Added a yellow pepper along with the others for color and after browning the meat and onions - threw everything into the crock-pot and cooked on high for 4 hours, adding the cooked rice in the last 10 minutes as instructed.  I did add 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and though we like things spicy I propably over did that slightly and next time I'd only use 1/2 teaspoon.  The taste was warm, fresh and as stated comforting.  A great recipe that's easy to put together.  Made for Spring PAC 2011",2011-03-04T07:02:37Z,2011-03-04T07:02:37Z

Instead of clam juice I used water plus ""Better than Boullion"" brand lobster base and I used a can of evaporated skim milk instead of the milk because to me the evaporated milk adds body without fat.

I put spring water, creamed honey and whole mint leaves in the blender and blended it until the honey was all mixed in and the leaves were almost indistinguishable.

1197120,412367,463435,Chef Buggsy Mate,4,This was really quite good...and a recipe I will make to take to the next church potluck as it will be different from all the others. The one thing everyone in the family said was that it needed a pinch more vinegar. I am guilty of adding a pinch more vinegar in my deviled eggs then most recipes call for. I think I will also add a nice grainy mustard next time as well in place of the yellow mustard. It is a fun recipe to play with.

But a few days later I reheated the leftovers, and swirled a good spoonful of mascarpone into the gravy - that smoothed out the flavor and made the gravy good enough to slurp.

First, I added the cleaned rice, broth, cloves, cardamom, and salt to the cooker, and let it go for the normal cycle.  When it switched to keep warm, I added the saffron and water.  It urned out beautifully!  Since I used stock instead of water, it was a little brown instead of pure white contrasting the golden yellow, but still very pretty.

1197278,409558,28177,Tinkerbell,5,"This is really an excellent GF recipe!  The bread rose very nicely, and as you say in the intro, the texture and density were perfect.  DH actually had to ask if it was GF or not.  Now that's when you know its a good recipe!  :)  I will definitely make this one again, but found that I missed a little spice in the flavor, so I'll probably throw in a dash of cinnamon and or fresh nutmeg.  But that's just personal preference, and DH doesn't like cinnamon anyway, so as far as he's concerned this recipe couldn't get any better!  I followed the recipe as written, but scaled it down to 1 loaf, as my banana-crazy DD ate two of the 6 bananas before I got a chance to make this.  In the case of reducing this recipe I needed 1-1/2 eggs, so I used one whole and one egg white.  Then I made a little boo-boo while letting DD (4 yrs old) measure flours and starches and I forgot the xanthan gum.  I realized it after the batter had been in the oven for about 3 minutes and knowing how important that gum is to GF baking, I pulled the pan out of the oven, sprinkled the xanthan over the top and then stirred it all in as best I could.  Even with that kind of mistake, this recipe turned out beautifully.  Mine baked up perfectly in 55 minutes (I started checking at 45 and added 5 each time), and we all agree that even though the inside is moist and soft, just like we're always looking for, that the slightly crunchy-sweet crust was our favorite part!

I had doubled the recipe because I make them and freeze them in food saver bags to go with my wonton broths I freeze. I had gotten 48 wontons.  I make the wontons and cook them in some boiling water that I had added chicken cubes or bouillon to. Cook them for the indicated time and then let them cool and then freeze with desired amounts in each bag. Then I take out the bag of wontons with the container of broth and let defrost, then simmer the broth then add the wontons so they could warm back up. No wontons fall apart this way. Has worked for me...I find if frozen in the soups they tend to fall apart more easily. <br/>Anyways these little bundles were absolutely yummy !!! Will definitely make again.

We discovered this at the LA Zoo, and from that day on we drank agua fresca everyday, trying all the different flavors, but watermelon and lime are my favorite.

I assumed since the onion was to be softened in the sherry that it was supposed to be dried onion, so that's what I used. I also used neufchatel cheese and light mayo. I was a little short on green olives (only had about 2 Tbsp) but just used what I had and thought it was fine. The only change I would make next time is maybe a little less sherry.

I simmered the spicy sauce while forming the balls, set the balls aside, then dropped the meatballs one by one into the hot sauce. I saw a pro chef suggest this because it makes for a more tender meatball. The meatballs won't stick to one another either. Another helpful tip, use a small cookie scoop to get perfect evenly sized meatballs. OOOPS, I just realized I forgot to add the flour...... they still turned out GREAT!

I added 1 tbsp of lemon to the apple slices (I used granny smith). 3. I brushed the top of the bottom crust with one egg white to prevent it from getting soggy. 4. I dotted the pie with 1 tbsp of butter before adding the top crust. 5. I brushed the top crust with milk, and sprinkled it with 1 tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. 6.

I used honey roasted peanuts as that is what I had and that was perfect for us.   Used 1/2 tsp of onion powder and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  I did, after my initial taste test, add red chopped onion as I like that in my chicken salad.  I served this as a snack with Club crackers.  So good.

They were simple to make and the cream was delicious although I did add a little icing sugar and some vanilla essence to it. I made the matchsticks quite small (around 5cm x 3cm) and served them to some children who really enjoyed them. The only problem I had was that I used cheap puff pastry which was very thin and so I had to use one piece on the bottom and one on the top rather than cutting one piece in half. Other than that, it's a great recipe and one that would be popular at kid's parties. Made for AUS/NZ Recipe Swap #50.",2011-03-05T18:41:01Z,2011-03-05T18:41:01Z

1197439,202944,987323,TreeSquirrel,4,"This is my first attempt at crab cakes.  I left off the green onions and used cooked, caramelized white onion.  I also used a big dash of cayenne pepper for more flavor.  My mixture was very moist, even after adding 1/3 cup of the breadcrumbs; therefore, I ended up adding a lot more breadcrumbs to the mixture.  My resulting crab cakes had a heavy bread crumb flavor, but were still soft in texture.  I don't know if this is how they're supposed to be, but I think I would prefer a patty without breadcrumbs holding it together.  The breadcrumbs did give me a nice golden, crunchy outer coating, which I enjoyed.  Also, the recipe doesn't specify to drain the crab, but I did.  For a first attempt at crab cakes, these were quite yummy and I ate three of them by myself!  Thank you for posting.",2011-03-05T22:48:41Z,2011-03-05T22:48:41Z

I used my chopper and cut everything up really small (didn't want them to see the veggies) and then dumped it all in the crock-pot without even sauteing it and cooked on high for 4 hours.  Only addition I did to it was add a 1/2 pound of ground round that I first cooked on the stove. The flavor was so fresh and clean is the best way I can describe it sort of reminded me of summer days when all the veggies are fresh.  This made a ton and I hav plenty put back in the freezer that we can enjoy later.  Made for Spring PAC 2010,2011-03-06T09:35:51Z,2011-03-06T09:35:51Z

I didn't have to cook the venison as long as it says (I believe I only baked it for about 6 1/2 hours).

1197618,270402,95217,jneen,5,I had a rib roast in the freezer that needed to be cooked.  Of course I came here looking for reviews.  I didn't want anything complicated and I wanted it to cook while I was at church.  This recipe was fantastic!  I seasoned the outside of the roast and then put the onions on.  I set the oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes because I wouldn't be home when it shut off.  I could have cooked it just a little longer...maybe another 15 or so minutes for a 5.25 lb roast.  It was medium rare at the outside but rare inside.,2011-03-06T15:25:21Z,2011-03-06T15:25:21Z

I didn't have the ritz crackers for the topping to I used panko instead.  I would probably consider making it again but as a side and not as a meal.  Thank you for the idea though!

I'm going to put it in my ""good enough for company"" cookbook. It's super easy to make, but it has just enough pizazz that it looks like you fussed over it.

Tossed the dough into the pre-heated, greased pot, scored it with a serrated knife, put the lid on and proceeded to bake as directed for 30 mminutes. I took the lid off after 30 min. and baked it another 10-15 min. Beautiful, crunchy, crispy outsides, tender, perfect crumb inside. This recipe is a beautiful, stream-lined version of the original no-knead bread which took much, much longer. That being said, I have to admit that the original recipe does seem to have a tang which this did not. However, for the sake of time, it's an understandable trade-off. Great recipe!

I implemented some of the (minor) tweaks suggested, all of which I recommend:  I used panko crumbs, doubled the sauce, thickened with some cornstarch & water, and added capers.

The whole almond with skin on only has to sit 3 minutes in boiling water (off the boil) and then the skin of each almond can easily be popped off using your fingers. I reduced the sugar a little I think, didn't use a measuring cup (never do) but I don't think I reduced it by half. I used sea salt & spring water plus the rest. I would make this again and like to try it with less almonds as it uses a lot and I think it would be just as creamy using somewhat less.

I was surprised that the kisses on the inside were still soft, even after the cookies had cooled; I'll be interested to see if they are still soft tomorrow! I unwrapped the kisses while watching TV, before starting on the dough, but checked to see how long it took me (about 20-25 min) so I would know about how long to chill the dough later. I used the dark chocolate kisses but I know someone who has made similar cookies and used some of the other various flavored kisses. After the dough had chilled, I started portioning out the dough into balls, which was good because I only got about 35 first go-round! I went back and made them smaller until I had 60 small balls. Because I had handled the dough so much, I put the balls back into the bowl (gingerly, so they wouldn't stick together) and into the fridge to chill a little. These are a bit piddly, having to wrap each kiss, but definitely worth the work :) Thanks so much for sharing!",2011-03-06T19:39:42Z,2011-03-06T19:39:42Z

Maybe the mayonnaise could me omitted and substituted with more cream cheese or cheese.  I used fresh spinach.  It was great with tostitos.

I made it the first time to the letter, and the second time, adjusted to use less black pepper. While the pork does come out really well, I finally figured out what I am missing. The smokey flavor. Since I don't have a smoker, I was wondering how I could go about infusing it into the pork. Liquid Smoke maybe?? Overall, I will keep trying.

Also, it says it serves 4, but when you read the recipe, it only makes 2 burgers.  This was a little confusing, but luckily I had extra mince in the freezer.  I did enjoy the sauce though, and I still like the concept of the pineapple inside the burger, I just think it needs a better burger recipe.

Since we had approximately 7.5 Gallons of Wort, in place of the water called for in this recipe we used the wort (Unfermented Beer), went together like a charm.  As a matter of fact, once we'd added 7.75 measuring cups of flour, it doubled in bulk in about 30 minutes.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 Stars is, it didn't brown like the recipe says it should.

One thing I would say is you must like eggplant to like this I love eggplant and you do get a lot of the lemon tang. I make a dish very similar to this recipe393169 but is made with mushrooms and at the end of cooking you sprinkle with some besan flour (chickpea) I think this would be great with some flour to thicken the wee bit sauce that you get in the bottom of your wok.

1197860,7682,51931,Trixyinaz,4,"Update 10/13/10:  Just made again last night and ended up cooking the chicken and the marinade in a pyrek dish.  I boilied up some pasta, cut up the chiken and mixed everything together.  The sauce was like a dumpling sauce and was terrific over the pasta with the chicken chunks mixed in.  **Orginal Review** Easy and delicious!  I used dried minced onions from a jar (had no real onions), and garlic powder (didn't have any fresh garlic either) and it still turned out great.  I had 2 frozen chicken breasts that I cut into strips.  I made the marinade and threw it over the chicken while it thawed or should I say, partially thawed.  It only marinaded just under 2 hours because we were starving and couldn't wait.  I lined my broiler pan with tin foil and put the somewhat frozen chicken on that.  I drizzled more of the marinade on top of the chicken and broiled it for about 9 minutes.  It was super tasty and so much better than just plain broiled chicken.  Served it with brown rice and steamed vegetables.  6 yo and husband thought it was really good.  Thanks for an easy, but very tasty marinade.  Next time I might add just a bit more lemon.

1197871,294777,246844,little_wing,4,"I made this, also using Pillsbury ready crust.  It was delicious!  Except for the mojo sauce.  I would omit it all together.  The cream/mustard mixture inside the pie, plus the cheese provided plenty of rich flavor.  I used a cuban spice rub on some pork loin and cooked in the the crock pot while at work.  Then shredded it when I got home.  Instead of topping with sliced pickles and tomatoes, I chopped the two together in what I called a pickle salsa, which was pretty and tasty and easier to eat, for us anyway.  I used plain yellow mustard, as that is what I'm used to having on cuban sandwiches and the flavor was perfect.  I think I might try doing little empanadas next time.

I love the hint of almond flavor.  Preparation was so EASY without having to roll out the dough! They're like miniature versions of Mrs. Field's sugar cookies.  I beat (cold) butter and cream cheese very well in a Kitchen Aid mixer and beat in the sugar slowly; they cooked with a perfect light color and cracked beautifully.  The only thing I did different was to gently roll each dough ball in course sugar before baking (I tried sprinkling it on at first but it just fell off).  I prefer having course sugar on top of sugar cookies.  I will definitely make these again!  Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe!",2011-03-07T10:29:11Z,2011-03-07T10:29:11Z
1197877,72135,583577,anonymous,4,This tasted good and was moist but I had some issues! I ended up wasting about half of the breadcrumb mixture just because it didn't stick well to the pork (which I rinsed in cold water and then dried thouroghly before rubbing with oil) so I think that next time I would only use 1 cup or 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs. The seasonings were good but I could have done with less salt - I would use about 1/2 teaspoon next time. After 25 minutes of roasting at 425 my pork was only at 120 degrees - I had to roast for about 50 minutes total to get between 160 and 170 degrees.,2011-03-07T10:32:55Z,2011-03-07T10:32:55Z

1197903,255227,262272,cookee monster,5,"Part 1.  I have never made or eaten fondant.  I looked on line, read recipes, watched videos.  And since I am not a neat cook I was a little nervous using all that powdered sugar.  I decided that I would start by mixing the marshmallow and sugar in the bowl.  It got to the point that I had to turn it out to knead on the counter.  I was doing pretty good until I got over confident and added to much sugar.  I ended up needing to be vacuumed off.  But I managed to make something that I think is fondant.  I have no idea what texture I'm going for really.  I've got dryish playdough.  I greased it and put it in a foodsaver canister (saw that on line).  I will be using the fondant on a cake in 5 days.  I will play around with it in a few days.  By the way, don't wear fuzzy slippers when you are making this.<br/><br/>Part 2. (March 3rd and 4th) I forgot to mention that I was making fondant because I have a Cricut Cake.  I needed my cake on the 5th so I decided that I would start practicing on the 3rd.  With the help of Tinkerbell I decided that my fondant was to dry.  Since I had a time crunch and couldn't start over I cut off a piece, added a few drops of water and nuked it until it was slightly warm.  I kneaded the water in and it was a little sticky.  That was ok because I wanted beige and brown fondant.  So I kneaded in some cocoa to get the colors I wanted.  Everything was looking good.  It rolled out nicely and I feed it to the Cricut.  No go.  I'm sure it would have been fine for other uses.  It was to soft for the machine.  I panicked for a moment (or 5) and remembered a video I saw on youtube.  A woman used marshmallow fondant but she let it dry overnight on the cutting mats.  So I filled my cutting mats and a few cutting boards and let them dry overnight.  The next day it was perfect.  My DS was thrilled with his cake and my DD can't wait for her birthday.<br/><br/>I had heard that fondant doesn't taste good.  This does.  The plain, light chocolate and chocolate (my favorite).

I used premade pie crusts, half of a 10 oz package of mixed veggies (corn, green beans, peas, and carrots), and added 1/4 cup cooked onion and one baking potato, cooked and cut into cubes.  (and bumped the spices up a little bit to make up for adding the onion and potato)        I also used 1% milk instead of cream or half and half, and it was still delicious!

I love that it is pretty healthy, too...compared to the real cheesy version. As I'm writing this review, I'm trying to stop myself from serving myself a 3rd serving! This is going into my Best of the Best Cookbook for 2011. Since it's winter, I skipped the basil and instead used a marinara sauce made with basil.

Using a food processor for the dough is so incredibly easy as well.  I cannot wait to make these again, because I am quite sure I won't be needing to buy flour tortillas ever again!  I might try half whole wheat flour next time",2011-03-07T13:29:40Z,2011-03-07T13:29:40Z

I only use one small can of tomato paste as the first time it seemed to have a bit of acidic note. 1 1/2 cups of tomato paste is a lot, so to balance it in the second batch I used less and added 1 cup really strong coffee.Coffee has a rounded almost earthy note which in the end sauce was robust and hearty but not too acidic.Served it with some gnocchi that I poured the sauce on and some greens.My hubby wolfed it down.For lunch I plan on pouring the braising sauce over some pasta and some bright green peas.YUMMY",2011-03-07T13:46:52Z,2011-03-07T13:46:52Z

Which is not going to happen on a school day for me, I need my sleep :o) I did tweak this just a bit.<br/>I omitted the OJ<br/>used evaporated milk in place of the regular milk<br/>I used approx. 2tsp. of vanilla ( I poured it in didn't measure)<br/>and I only used 3 eggs I was afraid of getting the ""eggy"" french toast. 3 eggs worked perfectly for me.

I also reduced the milk a smidge more than 1/2 as other reviewers mentioned.  The taste is very good, the colors are lovely, a creamy white interior and a crusty golden top.  I used a combo of mozzerella and monteray jack cheese as that is what I had.  Because I made only 1/2 the recipe I cut the time down to 40 min with the bell going off at 30 min to check in.  SO GLAD I DID!  It was done, noodles are just before too soft and the colors of the outer crust/rim in the beginning stage of brown.  So I took a taste....Lovely!  Creamy taste, just like old fashioned mac and cheese.  This is a keeper and next time I will make the full batch as I think this could be great for lunch leftovers for me for a week.",2011-03-07T14:07:39Z,2011-03-07T14:07:39Z

Ended up using half whole wheat flour, mixing a few teaspoons of the butter into the batter, and pouring the rest of about one-quarter cup on the top.  Oh, and the beer of the day was Kona Longboard.  A simple delight and a definite keeper.  Thank you!",2011-03-07T14:08:08Z,2011-03-07T14:08:08Z

I wanted something really quick after work, so I made long grain brown rice with broth in my rice cooker before hand.  When I came home, I quickly threw this together (fried the onion and garlic in oil, added the cooked chicken sausage, tomato paste, and canned beans, added the cooked rice, then topped it with the white pepper).

Very few dirty dishes-only a small bowl and a couple of measuring spoons for the sauce.  I used 8 ounces of thin spaghetti and about half the sauce covered it nicely.  Skipped the shrimp but cooked the sauce for a couple of minutes while the pasta drained (used the same pan, already hot from the pasta).  Tossed with the cilantro and pasta for a wonderful lunch.

I felt like I was going to go into a diabetic coma and couldn't finish my piece but it was so delicious :P I had a little trouble working with the filling since it was so sticky that it broke the crust a little, but so worth it.

I wound up using a little over 1/4 c Dijon and added an extra teaspoon of garlic to get it to balance out. I agree with *Parsley* that apple cider would be a better choice for next time to cut the sweetness. I also think I'll cut back to 1/8 c syrup. Thanks for posting.

I added an extra cup of water and it was still thick but much better than it would have been if I hadn't of added it.  I seasoned my chicken with a little bit of salt and pepper and sauteed with fresh garlic and shallots.

It was even better on the Lil' Smokies! Thanks for posting. Easy, cheap and tasty! (Plus the mommy-to-be ate almost half the pot of them and kept the leftovers!

1197987,66703,140132,mommyoffour,5,These really do melt in your mouth.  I made mine a bit small so I got about 4 1/2 dozen.  We loved these cookies.  Thank you for sharing these easy cookies that take no time at all to whip up.,2011-03-07T15:57:32Z,2011-03-07T15:57:32Z
1197988,258509,724516,Tea Jenny,5,This was nice it's my first time making satay sauce and it was very nice much better than shop bought. I made it exactly like your recipe and served it with salad I cooked it on the grill and basted the chicken with sauce while it was cooking and had some sauce on the side. Thank you for posting.

1197990,22859,583577,anonymous,4,I have been looking for the perfect chili powder recipe to make with my home dried peppers. This one is pretty good but it is a bit too heavy on the turmeric for my tastes. I used dried habaneros with the seeds included ground finely in a coffee grinder for the dried hot peppers and I left out the cloves. I also doubled the cumin because I love cumin! All in all this was a decent recipe but I think I will keep trying other recipes.,2011-03-07T16:23:45Z,2011-03-07T16:23:45Z
1197991,135350,738226,Prana Princess,5,Wonderful!!  I didn't deviate from the recipe even a little bit and it got rave reviews from ALL family members.  Rich and creamy comfort food at its best.

1197994,360863,844554,nemokitty,5,We had this for lunch this weekend and it worked out great! We ate it with Triscuits. I put in the whole can of water chestnuts and left out green pepper and pimientos (don't care for them). Hubby especially liked the green peas.

1197995,243009,844554,nemokitty,5,I followed the recipe exactly except cutting it in half for the 2 of us. We enjoyed it very much. It definitely is garlicky so you better like garlic if you're gonna make this one or cut the garlic down. We had it for lunch this weekend and also dinner.

1197996,436443,653438,mama smurf,5,Made this for Spring PAC 2011 to go along with another of your recipes Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Bell Pepper Sauce and Feta Cheese#439988.  I used a regular onion (vidalia onions aren't in season right now but I'm sure it really made no difference except I do love vidalia for their sweetness) and I also added just a little of the pasta water to make more of a sauce.  Other than that I followed the instructions and totally LOVED this dish.  Next time I might add some grilled shrimp just on top of the pasta.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.,2011-03-07T16:46:25Z,2011-03-07T16:46:25Z

1197998,359510,653438,mama smurf,5,Made this for our dinner along with Cucumber Tomato Salad#435122...DH devoured everything!  The only thing I did differently to the stroganoff was to add about 4-5 sliced mushrooms to use them up.  I sauteed them with the onions then added the ground beef and followed the isntructions.  I don't think you need the flour but I had a little oil in the pan so it helped absorbed it.  Wonderful dish and going into my Favorites of 2011.

1198000,63269,178427,CJAY8248,5,Terrific! I made this as directed except for the bread. I had to use french rolls. I cooked them on a pannini grill. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.,2011-03-07T16:57:12Z,2011-03-07T16:57:12Z
1198001,435122,653438,mama smurf,5,Made this for the Spring PAC 2011 tag game.  I followed the instructions only I had roma tomatoes so I used three of them.  Very tasty.

1198002,387972,58075,sassybee,4,"I made this several years ago.  I had been sick and I kept craving my grandmother's chicken spaghetti.  Whenever we have chicken spaghetti it's always the Velveeta recipe, which is good.  But I was wanting hers and the only thing I knew was that it was tomato-based.  So I started searching for a recipe.  This one sounded like pure comfort food to me, so I gave it a try.  It wasn't exactly like my grandmother's because I know she didn't use sour cream.  But it certainly did hit the spot.  (And quite honestly could be better than hers!)",2011-03-07T17:02:37Z,2011-03-07T17:02:37Z
1198003,398070,653438,mama smurf,5,Made this for our dinner tonight and I did cut the recipe in half (only I did use 1/2 can of the chicken and mushroom soups) used the rest in a vegetable soup with chicken.  I sliced onions and garlic and put them in the bottom of my crockpot and then followed the rest of the instructions.  It smells heavenly and I tasted the gravy and it tastes wonderful.  Will serve it over rice and with a green salad.  Thank you for submitting the recipe. Made for Spring PAC 2011.,2011-03-07T17:05:39Z,2011-03-07T17:05:39Z

1198011,340805,1745502,alvinakatz,4,This was a good and easy dip to put together. I made it with homemade yogurt and paired with lightly salted homemade tortilla chips. I did not include the lettace as I didn't have any in the fridge. The only thing was that it had a little too much yogurt so I increased the salsa to be the dominate taste.

I also used rice vinegar which I use in many Chinese recipes.  This is great cold and also heated which thickens up nicely for orange chicken.  Next time I will make the entire amount and leave it in the fridge for future meals.  Thx!!",2011-03-07T17:41:12Z,2011-03-07T17:41:12Z

It is a BIG cake, so I would halve the recipe if making for a smaller crowd.  Also, I didn't have to use a greased can in the center to get it to hold its shape--turned out beautifully without it.

1198021,48641,920864,Hi-desertKath,5,I made these again for Christmas and forgot to rate them. In the past I have used baking chocolate or chocolate chips and extract. This year I decided to try the Andes Mint Chocolate chips. I must say they are so much better with baking chocolate or Nestles chips. The Andes chips make a very thin coating and you can see the Ritz cracker through the chocolate. I did dip some of them twice and they were great but doing it 2 times is a pain.

I added a little lemon and salt to the cream sauce for flavor, and corn starch to thicken it a bit more. I served it over fried rice and it was excellent!!<br/>The whole thing was much easier than I'd expected and took very little time. <br/>And the best part--my mother loved it!

1198066,205733,253710,Burned Toast,3,"I didn't personally care much for the flavor or texture of these. My green peppers did not soften enough either (I did the microwave technique). Instead of nuking this (I cannot stomach the idea of microwaving hamburger), I baked them for 1 hour at 350 degrees without cooking the beef first. Also, they just barely fit in the 2.5 qt casserole I had, and the filling did not come close to fitting, so I had to stuff it all around the peppers. There was easily enough filling for 2 more peppers. I tripled the garlic but followed the rest of the recipe. I had only low sodium tomato sauce, so I added some salt at the table. To reduce my own carb content, I put some rice in the bottom of my pepper, packed on the beef mixture and then combined the rest of the rice with the beef for everyone else's peppers. The carb content just seemed weirdly high for this recipe, but I think I'll be okay when I test my sugars later. If I make this again, I will add more peppers, use a bigger container, cook the peppers longer and brown the beef first.",2011-03-07T20:37:22Z,2011-03-07T20:37:22Z

I undercooked two cups of rice on the stovetop and added them to the crock for about 30 minutes and everything thickened up beautifully. In the future I think I would drain the tomatoes to see if that improves the consistency for the recipe as it's written.

With the taco seasoning, you can hardly tell it's not ground beef. Plus, the ground turkey is healthier and cheaper! I added a can of corn and mixed it with the black beans before layering. I realized I didn't have enough sour cream, so I melted an 8 oz. package of low-fat neufchâtel cream cheese and it worked out fine. Our only dislike about the recipe was how soggy the tortillas were.. the ones at the bottom of the pan were okay, because they crisped up with the oil I used to grease the pan, but the ones in the middle layer were mush.

I really enjoyed the combination of dill and red onion. I used about 1/2 c green bell pepper and 1/2 finely chopped cucumber for the red pepper and it worked out fine. I also used reduced fat versions of the the sour cream and mayo. Served with recipe #309638 (whole wheat pita for bread maker) and a nice green salad. Delish!

My husband even said that is was really good, without me even asking what he thought. It was also very filling. I cut the recipe down to a 2-serving portion, because it was just the two of us (still using one egg), and I used French Swiss cheese, because my Safeway was out of guyere, and they said that was a good substitute. I also used 5 oz. chicken breasts in place of the thighs, which worked well. I served this with Brussels sprouts and tater tots. (I know, decresaingly classy.) :) Thanks!

Didn't have any fresh basil, so I just sprinkled in some dried. Fried the eggs because I've never poached an egg and I was worried I would screw it up. ;-) Used red chile pepper flakes since I didn't have fresh. Oh, and I didn't have any spaghetti, linguine, or fettucine (I was shocked), so I used gemelli (kind of like a tight rotini) and it worked just fine. Next time, I would add even more of the chard stems -- they really picked up all the flavors of the dish and added a great texture. I'm always looking for new ways to use the chard that seems to come every week in our organic produce delivery and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious cake with lovely texture - totally a fast keeper that made excellent use of 2 rapidly darkening bananas.  Toasted the walnuts until dark brown (more like a heaping cup) & mixed as directed. Used a mix of cut up Hershey's milk chocolate  bars & dark chocolate Hershey's kisses. Made in a 9 x 13 inch pan - took an additional 20 minutes to fully cook - so worth the wait! From mixing to baking - done & washed up in under a hour. Will be using this for summer potlucks. Tastes even better the next day! Moist without being mushy or greasy - YAY!

Personally, I use a good teaspoon of brown sugar for each brochette - though this is personal taste.  I use a small glass of single cream - this would probably be a little more than an eighth of a cup (depends on the size of the cup!).

I have an older oven and does not keep the temperature good so I tent mine with foil while baking and use a thermometer to ensure 190 degrees before taking out of oven.

1198202,228949,268501,OliveLover,0,"After reading the other reviews, I made this making one drastic change in procedure, leaving the ingredients pretty much as they are.  However, I'm not certain that this gave us the same dish, so rating it is tough, which is why I'm not giving it any stars.<br/><br/>Rather than brown the tofu on high with peanut oil, stir-frying the seasonings, wilting the chard and then, adding the sauce, I added the sauce in two additions.  I divided the amount of the sauce into two bowls, using only about 2.5 tbsp. peanut butter in each, cutting the amount down by almost half and dividing the soy sauce and mirin.  Instead of the peanut oil alone, I used 2 tbsp. total of dark sesame oil.<br/><br/>I heated the wok, then turned the heat down to medium and added the first bowl of sauce contents along with half the sesame oil, stirring it into a paste.  Then, put in the tofu and allowed it to get coated and browned in it.  Then, removed it from the pan.<br/><br/>Next, with the heat still at medium, I added about a tsp of peanut oil, the onion, garlic and chili pepper and allowed the onion to turn translucent then added the second addition of sauce ingredients, including the last tbsp of sesame oil, again stirring it into a sauce.  I added the chard, which I'd pretty finely chopped, to that, constantly stirring.  When wilted, I added the tofu back in.  I finished the dish with some chopped peanuts I'd roasted beforehand in a small amount of peanut oil.  <br/><br/>I'd also added a small amount of Thai soy sauce, which has a thicker, molasses-y quality.  Our only complaint was that the dish was a bit too sweet, and next time, would omit the Thai soy sauce and perhaps adjust the ratio of mirin to soy sauce.  Maybe a shot of fish sauce?  And I might up the amount of chard, as well.<br/><br/>Weill make this again, with this method.  I also want to thank Lindsay, who posted Noodles and Spinach with Tofu (369058) which we make pretty often, for giving me this way for making a peanut sauce.  But, as I finish up the leftovers while writing this, once more have to say that don't feel I can give it any stars because the cooking process I used radically changed what was to have been the end result, so I'm not comparing apples to apples.",2011-03-04T13:52:20Z,2011-03-04T13:52:20Z

I noticed that one reviewer was not happy with the ""spiciness"" of the jalapenos.  I can immediately think of two reasons that could happen.  First it is the chilies themselves, jalapenos used to have a reputation for heat but now most of them seem to be too mild to be of much use.  I believe this is because so many of them are now force fed with fertilizers and water to make them grow faster and thus generate more profits.  It is a known fact that jalapenos grown under stress from a lack of water and a lot of hot sun will be hot.  In the store you can identify the hottest ones by the ""stretch marks"" running vertically in the skin.  The second possible reason for the result not being spicy or hot is the failure to use the Rotel brand of tomatoes used by Paula.  These tomatoes are canned with hot jalapenos included in the mix.  Regular canned tomatoes will be tame by comparison.",2011-03-04T16:20:13Z,2011-03-04T16:20:13Z

I added an additional cup of water and let it cook the remaining time and all was well but it could have had a little more water still. What I will do next time is brown and lightly cook the chops and set aside with a cover on. I would use 2 1/2 C of water for each (1) CUP of rice, then the last 15-20 min II would take the foil off, place the chops on top and back for the remaining time uncovered.

I was so happy to find this recipe this year because it uses vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (I no longer eat meat.) I thought the soup would lack something without the traditional chicken stock, but was absolutely delicious! (Some tips: I found it only needed FOUR cups of broth, which made it nice and thick. I also substituted half the olive oil for fresh butter for a richer, creamier taste. Then I added a dash of white pepper, a flavoring many other leek soup recipes call for. For the cheese toasts I used a combo of cheddar and gruyere too, because that's what I had in my fridge at the time. It was excellent.)<br/><br/>The savory soup combined with the crusty sourdough garlic cheese toast is a perfect and very satisfying meal.

However it lacks the richness that i look for in chocolate cakes -- owing i think to the fewer eggs used and no butter. Also, i substituted espresso coffee for the water, which turned the cake a bit more bitter, losing much of the sweetness. A tip to those wishing to use coffee -- add more sugar to the mixture, or substitute only half the water. Instead of a chocolate frosting, I whipped up a creamy chocolate sauce and smothered a cake slice with the warm sauce -- a fantastic idea, it seemed, and added the richness that was lacking in the cake.",2011-03-06T05:43:02Z,2011-03-06T05:43:02Z

The meat needs to be browned in some oil, otherwise it will stick terribly to your pot.  The recipe as it stands is VERY tomatoey, and acidy.  The barley was also too chewy on the times given, and the soup was too thick.  We ended up diluting it out with a couple cups of bouillon broth, and added some sugar, and it was very good at that point.

We did as another reviewer recommended and added about 3 cups of chopped fresh spinach that we needed to use up. We also used about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped tarragon because that needed to be used up, too... and wow am I ever glad we did! That totally made the dish! Because tarragon has such a delicate flavor, we used only 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. We also used chicken thighs instead of breasts (the texture of the thighs worked better with the mushrooms than breasts would have). The only thing about the dish that wasn't perfect was that the sauce wasn't creamy enough. We used light sour cream, so that may be why. Next time, we may add extra sour cream and see if that makes it creamier. Overall, it was a hit! Thanks for posting!",2011-03-07T21:39:57Z,2011-03-07T21:39:57Z

When I started cooking, I thought I had both a can of Rotel and a can of diced tomatoes, but when I went to add them to the soup, I had neither!  I subbed about 25 oz of crushed tomatoes and 3 tbsp of verde salsa.  Also, I had no carrots, and I think they woud definitely have added some good flavor.  I used bbq grilled chicken breast and a combo of sharp cheddar and jack.  I'll definitely make this again with the right ingredients and probably be adding another 5 star review.

1198613,344389,593927,UmmBinat,5,"Thank you! I was not able to taste these as I am gluten free but they were given as a gift and shared with guests of the given so they must be good. I made the cupcakes in large muffin tins with liners the day before frosting them and filled with the filling after cool then wrapped each individually in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator over night & frosted the next day. It was easier that way and it let the filling sit in the cupcakes in the refrigerator which a reviewer said made them better so I would do it in a similar way if making them again. I made these with a different moist devils food cake mix. Instant coffee made up and canola oil. For the filling I used homogenized milk, a gluten free flour mix (rice flour & tapioca starch) as that is all I had but it did get a bit thick but I may not have measured precisely as I don't use measuring cups, halal vanilla bean paste, plus the rest of the ingredients call for. I used store bought buttercream frosting out of ease and ingredients on hand. I did not have a frosting bag so I cut a small hole in the corner of a ziplock freezer bag (thicker plastic) and it worked pretty well. I sliced a small cut into the tops with a knife and pushed the corner of the bag in. Many of the muffins did crack but it was my first time and I may have squeezed to much in, the frosting covered the cracks anyway. I loved the reduction in heat method as they came out way better than usual, not forming pointed cracked tops.

Other than that change the recipe was made with the ingredients called for.Since I don't care for the way the bread looks when it's baked in the machine,only the dough cycle was used.After placing the bread dough in a greased loaf pan, it was covered and left to rise in a warm oven for about 45 minutes. Then it was baked for about half an hour at 350 degrees. And now to describe the taste,I spread a bit of margarine on a warm slice and OMGoodness!!! it was wonderful.

If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it; it tastes exactly like regular pasta, but doesn't raise blood sugar) and substituted some julienned sun dried tomatoes (packed in oil) instead of the plum tomatoes. I added a couple pinches of crushed red peppers too. And topped it off with some shredded Parmesan cheese. The dish was colorful with the fresh spinach against the red of the tomato and sausage, and the browned mushrooms. I did increase the garlic to 3 cloves from 2. And deleted the basil.

If you wanted to add things or substitute different ingredients, it's easy enough to work with, but it's good just as it is. The top had just enough crunch, while the center was tender but not cake-like.<br/><br/>I try to avoid shortening, so I used a combination of extra light olive oil and melted butter. Then I couldn't decide between sugar or no sugar, so I split the difference and added half the suggested amount. I liked it that way, but it was barely detectable, so if you like a sweet cornbread, add the full amount.<br/><br/>I used a trick I read in a different recipe and soaked the cornmeal in the milk for five minutes before adding the egg and oil.

I started out with a regular casserole dish (11x9) but when I started to layer the first half of the squash, it seemed too big.  So I moved down to a 9x9 dish.  This was *almost* too small, and some of the juice dribbled over the top of the pan and into the oven.  I still think the 11x9 would be too big. Next time I will try to find a deeper 9x9.<br/>2. Squash is very juicy, and the juice cooks out.  This ended up making quite a lot of liquid. When you cut a couple of squares of lasagna out of the pan, there is a good bit of ""broth"" left over.  Next time I make this recipe (and I WILL be making this again!) I may try placing the squash ""noodles"" into a strainer for an hour or more to drip some of the liquid out before layering it into the casserole dish.  Or maybe I will squeeze them in some cheesecloth.<br/>Other than that, this was an easy and delicious recipe.  Definitely a keeper.",2011-03-08T19:51:58Z,2011-03-08T19:51:58Z

I usually make an Apple Dutch Baby pancake I found in a Sesame Street cookbook, but was looking for something a little different. This has quite a bit more sugar than the other recipe, so I would not make this as written too often (I need to watch my carb/sugar intake) -I used raw sugar but will use Stevia next time. It was very easy and very tasty. I used freshly ground whole soft wheat, which gave it a nice texture and flavor, and was very generous with the cinnamon in the apples (left it out of the batter, my preference).

For you American's out there - 350 degrees, 1 stick of melted butter, 8x11 pan, and I would recommend tidbits vs chunks (I'm sure they weren't around when recipe was written and probably not in Australia).  I looked at the batter and went ""no way this will fit in a 13x9x2 pan"", so I put it in a smaller casserole dish.  Mistake, I should have used my 8x12 meatloaf pan, or even the 13x9x2.  I'll try those pans next time and let you know.  The batter has a light sweetness and the cake is light and fluffy. Leftovers are great for breakfast with a cup of tea.  I'll definitely be making again.  VERY quick and easy to put together.  One note - let it cool.  I burned my tongue on the pineapple. <br/><br/>Thanks Cookingpompom!

Once the pepper is submerged within the folds of the rice/beans, coconut milk, and has cooked, the taste, (not the heat) is what stands out. The coconut base is right on, and was ever so easy to put together. I served this with lamb, but can be seriously served as a stand-alone, lovely dish.

Once both sides were brown ~ threw rest of the veggies and goodies in ~ warmed up, and served with a dollop of sour cream love!

In my next batch, I will reduce the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons and add maybe 1/16th to 1/8 teaspoon of Allspice.  It doesn't need much but when you compare the two sauces side by side (like I just did), you will get a distinct hit right away of the Allspice with Heinz.  It's still a nice sauce and very easy to make and a lot less money than the original ($3.50 for the Heinz).  I've never used Tomato Puree before and someone told me to blend 6oz of Tomato Paste with 15oz Tomato Sauce.  It worked great!  If I double that (2 cans of each), I'll have enough ""Puree"" for a triple batch of this chili sauce!  I used 12oz of the chili sauce and 10oz of grape jelly plus 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice as a sauce to cook my browned pork chops in a crockpot.

I used rum for it and used 4 whole eggs and 4 egg yolks to try to avoid the egginess that others described. I didn't find it eggy. The prep is detail heavy, but once you get past that, it's easy breezy--just a waiting game. My oven has a proofing feature which I LOVE since my house can be drafty. I thought the dough was so nice and soft when I was cutting it out that I knew these would be good--and they were. Lovely, huge paczki. I did fill them with blueberry preserves before frying and I must say you really need to test one to see if they are getting done. My first few were very gummy in the center and I ended up throwing them in the oven at 350 with some foil over them so they could finish up--this worked if you need to fix yours. :) I did fry some unfilled, and that was a no-brainer easy one.

We used one very large onion, doubled the garlic, perhaps cooked that bit longer than 5 minutes before adding the lentils. We used dry beef stock mix that already had sodium so we didn't add any additional salt. We tripled the oregano (at least) and used healthy pinch of cayenne.

Next time, I think I'll put a timer on 15 minutes.",2011-03-09T09:00:51Z,2011-03-09T09:00:51Z

I baked it at 375 for 1 hour on the middle oven rack and the skin got crispy and delicious. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for posting.,2011-03-09T09:06:48Z,2011-03-09T09:06:48Z

Thought about making a quick trip down the road to get some, but when I tasted it, it was completely delicious without them (thanks to the cream cheese). Didn't add the nuts, only added one box of pudding mix. Also used the ""whipped"" version of the cream cheese. And, I added pineapple juice until it was to my desired consistency. <br/><br/>One more thing -- I didn't have crushed pineapple, but did have canned pineapple chunks.

I cut the recipe in half, and got 8 fritters, plus a little batter that was too thin to use.  Next time, I'll add a bit less water to the yolk and cornflour mixture, since the final batter was just a touch too thin.  Maybe 1/2 tablespoon- for a half recipe.  Start with less, you can always add more.  I shallow fried these in a skillet, but next time I think I'll pull out the deep fryer, as my final product was a bit greasy, and that's typically a sign that the oil was too cool.  Even a bit greasy, these were wonderful to eat, and I look forward to the leftovers tomorrow.  For the dip, I used recipe #328368 for the chermoula, and it made a great accompaniment.

Other than that followed the simple clear directions to the letter.  I STRONGLY advise anyone making this NOT to make the mistake I did.  It clearly states ""to let it cool for 3 hours before slicing"" I got overly eager and cut it way to early and the first slice was runny and not so pretty.

When I added the oil to the oats, I also stirred in 2 Tbs. real maple syrup and a pinch more vanilla then the recipe called for. I also added the coconut, and sunflower seeds. Then once the first hour was up, I stirred in some chopped dried apricot, chopped dried apple, dried tart cherries, dried cranberries, cashew pieces, and some roasted cinnamon. Now my house smells heavenly! I will definitely make this often. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Kathy. Now comes the hard part....I have to share the muesli.

Added 2 carrots in the beginning and no extra carrots or onions at the end.  Added 1 cup red wine (mmmm) for 4 total cups of liquid with the beef broth.

I'm always looking for good baked potato/wedges recipe and this fit the bill nicely.<br/><br/>A couple of notes: I cut the potato wedges in advanced (a couple hours earlier), marinated them with an eyeballed amount of olive oil (probably around or less than a tablespoon, it was only for 2 as a side dish) and seasoned them with the dry rub.  They held up great in the fridge and helped get dinner on the table a little easier.  <br/><br/>Another thing, I used a significantly smaller amount of the dry rub than suggested.  Otherwise, it would have been WAY too much seasoning.  In fact, the recipe as written came out to 4 full servings for me.  Since I cook for 2, I tossed the dry seasoning in a Ziplock for an awesome pre-made packed for another time.",2011-03-10T17:42:28Z,2011-03-10T17:42:28Z

Once I added the mixture to the casserole dish, if it looks a little dry separately mix up additional heaping spoonfuls of each soup and add broth and pour over the casserole. I baked this for about 30 minutes, checking the tenderness of my rice. After I pulled it from the stove, I added a little more soup and broth mixture to set the right creamy consistency for my taste.

We had the leftovers tonight and HE loved it, as did I.  It definitely improves with a day of aging!  I made some changes, due to availability of ingredients: I used 2 14.5 oz. cans of chopped tomatoes with Italian seasonings and then added a bit of dried basil, oregano and parsley (just a couple of shakes of each).  I didn't have quick-cooking rice so I used about 2/3 cup of Uncle Ben's and added water when I thought it was getting too dry....that worked so well I would do it the same way the next time I make this.  Also, and the main reason I made this recipe, I used about 3/4 of a bag of coleslaw mix....sliced cabbage and carrots.  I had it in the fridge and didn't want to waste it so this ended up being a clean out the fridge recipe that worked out just great.  The only thing I would pay more attention to is the cider vinegar....I was a bit careless with the measurement and added a bit more than the recipe stated (my fault) and, at first, I thought I had ruined the recipe because the taste was so strong but after I added the rice, and more water, the taste was perfect.  We really loved this recipe for it's simplicity and for using ingredients you have around the kitchen, especially those bags of cabbage you get from the produce department!

Since I used spicy sausage instead of sweet, I left out the red pepper flakes and hot sauce.

For the chicken we used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts which we cut in half, seasoned with cajun spices, salt, & pepper, and then seared in 2 tsp of oil. Doing it this way our chicken was juicy and flavorful. It also added a nice spicy contrast to the sweet potatoes. We had this with a side of broccoli and were both satisfied at the end of the meal.

I must admit I was guilty of eyeballing the salt, pepper, ground cumin and salsa. I used a jar of chipotle salsa as I thought the smoky flavor from the fire roasted chillies would add a nice flavor. It really blended well with the Neufchatel cheese. Best of all I like the fact that I didn't have to grate a block of cheese. My family has a tendency to put a mound of cheese on their tacos and burritos...the use of the Neufchatel made this recipe far more diet friendly.

I skipped the malt syrup too. Delicious! Good with a little dollop of sour cream or yogurt too.<br/>A tip for the chipotles I learned for soup making - buy the canned ones in adobo. Lay a sheet of wax paper on a cookie sheet and lay each chili on it. Heap a big spoonful of sauce on each and freeze. When frozen, toss them all in a freezer bag. To use for something like this chili, simply take a frozen one out and chop it up - you get the chili and sauce all in one.",2011-03-12T00:43:32Z,2011-03-12T00:43:32Z

1199781,447884,88099,Nimz_,5,Excellent combination of flavors in this dish.  I didn't have 2 cans of black beans so I used 1 can of red kidney beans and we loved it.  I also probably used more cheese than stated as I didn't measure.  I lightly browned my tortiallas prior to adding the bean mixture to it.  They were still a little on the soggy side.  Next time I will drain off the liquid and see if that help.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Spring 2011,2011-03-12T13:51:50Z,2011-03-12T13:51:50Z

I let mine marinade overnight as directed and was very pleased with the results.  This would be great to take to potlucks.  I will probably only used about 1/2 the sugar next time and see if that works.  Just a little on the sweet side for DH.  I did use splenda and that seemed to work well for us.  Thanks for sharing.

1199783,373627,320849,Meredith C-ville,5,"Great (with modifications). I just used boneless skinless thighs which I steamed then shredded. I used white onion which I sauteed first. I did not have cilantro but I added some fresh spinach for color instead. I added chopped black olives and an avocado (would have put it only on top but it had brown spots). I also had to used canned tomato (drained) because the fresh ones were not appealing. I also added cumin and some garlic powder. It was very tasty. For the corn cakes, I had to use grits rather than cornmeal, I used two whole eggs plus two whites, I used cottage cheese rather than ricotta, and only had half the amount of corn. These were amazing because they were actually easy to cook without using a ton of oil. I have a different recipe for something similar that I always have difficulty with. I served the chicken part warm and served it all with grated sharp cheddar. Thanks!",2011-03-12T13:58:48Z,2011-03-12T13:58:48Z

1199885,305402,1340977,SoNottaCook,2,I made these because I wanted something different than normal green beans but we didn't care for them much at all. Sorry.,2011-03-12T21:02:24Z,2011-03-12T21:02:24Z
1199886,443035,232480,RSL5709,5,"Interesting recipe.  I've never made refrigerator rolls before.  I used my KitchenAid stand mixer with the dough hook to mix this up - it took less than 10 minutes easily, with no kneading.  Placed into a bowl, covered with a damp towel, and into the fridge.  About 6 hours later I pulled it out, punched it down, and pulled off about 9 golf ball sized pieces to let rise for dinner tonight.  They turned out very soft but definitely not doughy, with a really lovely taste.  Super easy recipe, takes almost no time, and I'm looking forward to fresh rolls for the next few days!

1199889,425105,452355,Dr. Jenny,5,"We made these chicken breasts for dinner last night and they were easy, fast to make and very tasty.  I easily halved the recipe to suit 4 breasts, used a little more feta since I love it, and cheated and used a jarred roasted red pepper as I realized I didn't have a fresh one on hand.  I served with roasted eggplant.  Thanks!",2011-03-12T21:08:26Z,2011-03-12T21:08:26Z

The frosting was an interesting recipe, but I didn't find it the consistency of a glaze really...more like thinned out canned frosting I think.  I'll keep this cake recipe, but next time use my own frosting recipe, I think.  Made for PAC Spring '11.",2011-03-12T21:13:37Z,2011-03-12T21:13:37Z

I haven't actually fixed it for dinner yet but I took a couple of bites before freezing it and WOW! I really loved it. I decided to not even wait for hubby to taste it before reviewing it because I know he will love it too. I, like other reviewers, didn't layer but mixed it all together. Thanks so much for posting this because it's a nice change from the normal spaghetti.",2011-03-12T21:13:54Z,2011-03-12T21:13:54Z
1199894,405108,383346,Boomette,5,So yummy.  Next time I'll try with bacon grease to give more flavor.  I cooked the potatoes a little bit too much and they were too soft.

1199897,143874,174096,Starrynews,5,"Wonderful dish!  I used the suggested mushrooms, onions, and asparagus for the veggies - will be sure to try zucchini when there is an abundance during the summer!  I included the optional peas, used brown sugar, lite coconut milk, and low sodium chicken broth (and omitted the salt - personal preference).  We very much enjoyed this.  We liked the zip imparted by the curry powder.  Thanks for sharing!",2011-03-12T21:22:32Z,2011-03-12T21:22:32Z

If you want to thin it down a bit, leave the lid on when simmering or add a little milk.  I used an immersion blender to break up some of the larger pieces of broccoli.

1199901,87698,260323,Lets Eat,5,Fantastic!  This recipe could not be any easier and it is delicious.  Only thing I did diffrently was sear all sides of meat in cast iron skillet and then I added a few whole cloves of garlic in the roasting pan along with the whole onion.  I used an immersion blender to chop the onion and garlic up into the gravy.  This is a great recipe. Thank you.,2011-03-12T21:33:38Z,2011-03-12T21:33:38Z

1199903,399765,204024,Lavender Lynn,4,"This was quite good and I'd be proud to serve it to most anybody, but it seems like the sort of thing you'd do with a cheaper, tougher cut of meat, say, bottom round. Sirloin is really at its best if you sear it good on both sides and throw it right on the plate; the fall-apart fork-tender look isn't the best display of this cut. We used fresh thyme from the back yard and wished we'd used less. Also, I'd suggest adding salt only at the end, with the cornstarch thickener, for less shrinkage of the meat.  Overall, we enjoyed this very much except that it looked better going into the crockpot than coming out. Made for PAC.",2011-03-12T21:37:19Z,2011-03-12T21:37:19Z

I couldn't find Italian-style turkey sausage, so I got a 14 oz. package of smoked turkey sausage. Also, I buy huge honkin' containers of baby spinach at Costco (I love spinach) so I just grabbed a big handful and threw it into the pot. I even forgot the butter at the end, but we didn't even miss it! You're right, the broth is excellent - albeit, a bit spicy - and I had mine more soupy while my husband had his more veggie-y. :) We topped our servings with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese and also had French bread on the side.
